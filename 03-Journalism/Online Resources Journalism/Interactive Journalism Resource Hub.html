    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calm Harmony -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is designed as an interactive dashboard and filterable directory. This structure was chosen over a linear report format to empower users to actively explore and find relevant information quickly, which is the primary goal of a resource collection. The top-level dashboard provides an immediate, high-level synthesis of the knowledge base's composition (resources by category, key themes via keywords). Below, the filterable card grid allows for deep, user-driven exploration. This two-part structure (synthesis + exploration) makes the dense information from the report highly consumable and turns a static list into a functional tool. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        1. Report Info: Resource counts per category -> Goal: Compare -> Viz: Bar Chart -> Interaction: Hover tooltips -> Justification: Best for comparing discrete counts across multiple categories. Library: Chart.js.
        2. Report Info: Keyword frequency -> Goal: Show Proportions/Themes -> Viz: Donut Chart -> Interaction: Hover tooltips -> Justification: Clearly shows the main thematic focus areas of the resource collection. Library: Chart.js.
        3. Report Info: Full resource list -> Goal: Explore & Access -> Presentation: Filterable Card Grid -> Interaction: Category select filter, free-text search filter, clickable links -> Justification: Provides a scannable, visually organized, and powerful way for users to drill down to the specific resources they need. Method: HTML/CSS/JS.
        4. Gemini Integration: Synthesize Themes (LLM summary of filtered results) -> Goal: Synthesize & Learn -> Interaction: Button click, LLM API call.
        5. Gemini Integration: Resource Elaborator (LLM structured analysis per card) -> Goal: Deep Context -> Interaction: Button click, LLM API call.
