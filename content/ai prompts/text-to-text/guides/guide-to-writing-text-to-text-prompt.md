## Pre-Writing Phase: Discovery & Planning

### Step 1: Define Your Chatbot's Core Purpose

**Primary Question**: What is the single most important thing your chatbot must accomplish?

**Exercise**: Complete this sentence in 25 words or less:

> "This chatbot exists to [primary action] for [target users] so that [desired outcome]."

**Examples**:

- ✅ "This chatbot exists to resolve customer service issues for e-commerce shoppers so that they can complete purchases without human intervention."
- ❌ "This chatbot helps customers." (Too vague)

**Validation Checkpoint**:

- [ ] Purpose is specific and measurable
- [ ] Target audience is clearly defined
- [ ] Desired outcome is achievable
- [ ] Scope is appropriately bounded

---

### Step 2: Audience & Context Analysis

**Method A: If You Have Direct User Access**

1. Interview 5-10 target users
2. Document their pain points
3. Record their exact language/terminology
4. Note their expertise level (novice/intermediate/expert)
5. Identify common scenarios they encounter

**Method B: If You Don't Have Direct User Access**

1. Review existing customer service transcripts
2. Analyze support ticket data
3. Survey internal stakeholders
4. Research competitor chatbots
5. Create user personas based on available data

**Context Mapping Exercise**:

Create a context map using this template:

```
USER PROFILE
├── Demographics: [Age, role, industry, location]
├── Technical Proficiency: [Scale 1-10]
├── Domain Knowledge: [Novice/Intermediate/Expert]
└── Primary Goals: [List 3-5 goals]

OPERATIONAL CONTEXT
├── Platform: [Web, mobile app, messaging platform]

└── Languages: [Supported languages]

CONSTRAINTS
├── Budget: [Cost per interaction target]
├── Response Time: [Maximum acceptable delay]
├── Compliance: [Industry regulations]
└── Technical: [System limitations]
```

**Validation Checkpoint**:

- [ ] User expertise level documented
- [ ] Common scenarios identified (minimum 5)
- [ ] Constraints are realistic and measurable
- [ ] Context is comprehensive enough to guide decisions

---

### Step 3: Requirements Gathering

**Method A: Comprehensive Approach (For Complex Projects)**

Use this structured interview format:

**Functional Requirements**

1. What tasks must the chatbot perform? (List all)
2. What decisions must it make autonomously?
3. When should it escalate to humans?
4. What data must it access or collect?
5. What integrations are required?

**Non-Functional Requirements**

1. What tone and style is appropriate?
2. What response time is acceptable?
3. What accuracy level is required?
4. What compliance standards apply?
5. What security measures are needed?

**Method B: Quick-Start Approach (For Simple Projects)**

Answer these 10 essential questions:

1. **Primary task**: What is the #1 thing it does?
2. **User input**: What will users typically ask?
3. **Success metric**: How do you measure success?
4. **Tone**: Formal, casual, or somewhere between?
5. **Length**: Short answers or detailed explanations?
6. **Errors**: What should it never do or say?
7. **Escalation**: When does a human need to take over?
8. **Data**: What information does it need access to?
9. **Format**: Bullet points, paragraphs, or structured responses?
10. **Edge cases**: What are the 3 trickiest scenarios?

**Validation Checkpoint**:

- [ ] All stakeholder requirements captured
- [ ] Priority ranking completed (must-have vs. nice-to-have)
- [ ] Conflicts identified and resolved
- [ ] Technical feasibility confirmed

#### 5.1: Define Core Behavioral Principles

**Principle Categories**:

```
ETHICAL BEHAVIOR
└── Honesty, transparency, fairness

SAFETY BEHAVIOR
└── User protection, harm prevention

PROFESSIONAL BEHAVIOR
└── Consistency, reliability, competence

SOCIAL BEHAVIOR
└── Courtesy, respect, empathy
```

**Core Principles Template**:

```markdown
### Foundational Behavior Principles

**Honesty & Transparency**:
- Always acknowledge uncertainty rather than fabricating information
- Clearly distinguish between facts, opinions, and recommendations
- Disclose limitations in your knowledge or capabilities
- Correct errors immediately when discovered

**User-Centered Approach**:
- Prioritize user needs over conversation efficiency
- Adapt complexity to user's demonstrated understanding
- Respect user time by being concise when appropriate
- Empower users with knowledge, not just answers

**Professional Standards**:
- Maintain consistent tone and quality across all interactions
- Follow through on commitments made during conversation
- Preserve context and continuity in multi-turn exchanges
- Uphold brand values in every response
```

#### 5.2: Define Interaction Protocols

**Method A: Scenario-Based Protocols** (Recommended for most chatbots)

Structure each protocol as: **When [situation] occurs, then [behavior]**

```markdown
### Interaction Protocols

**When user first initiates contact:**
- Greet warmly and professionally
- Briefly state your capability and purpose
- Ask clarifying questions to understand intent
- Set appropriate expectations for the conversation

**When user provides vague or incomplete information:**
- Acknowledge what you understand so far
- Ask specific, targeted questions to fill gaps
- Offer examples to clarify what you need
- Never make assumptions without confirmation

**When user expresses frustration or dissatisfaction:**
- Acknowledge their emotion explicitly ("I understand this is frustrating")
- Apologize for any shortcomings (when appropriate)
- Focus on solution rather than justification
- Escalate to human if emotion persists or intensifies

**When user requests something outside your capabilities:**
- Clearly state what you cannot do and why
- Offer alternative approaches within your capabilities
- Suggest appropriate resources or escalation paths
- Never attempt tasks beyond your defined scope

**When conversation becomes off-topic:**
- Gently redirect to your primary purpose
- Acknowledge the tangent politely
- Restate what you can help with
- Offer to conclude if user needs are outside scope

**When user provides positive feedback:**
- Thank them genuinely
- Ask if there's anything else you can help with
- Reinforce what you did well for future interactions
- Conclude professionally if they're satisfied
```

**Method B: Rule-Based Protocols** (For highly structured interactions)

```markdown
### Behavioral Rules

**Communication Rules**:
1. Use [2nd person / 1st person plural] perspective ([You/We])
2. Keep sentences under [X] words for clarity
3. Use bullet points when listing more than [X] items
4. Ask no more than [X] questions at once
5. Provide summaries after complex explanations

**Confirmation Rules**:
1. Confirm understanding before proceeding with requests
2. Verify critical information (numbers, dates, names)
3. Recap action items at end of complex interactions
4. Ask for feedback after major information deliveries

**Escalation Rules**:
1. Escalate after [X] failed attempts to resolve
2. Escalate immediately if user requests human assistance

3. Remind users not to share: [passwords, SSN, etc.]
4. Clear session data containing personal information
```

#### 5.3: Define Emotional Intelligence Guidelines

**Emotion Recognition & Response Template**:

```markdown
### Emotional Intelligence Framework

**Detecting User Emotion:**
Monitor for these indicators:
- **Frustration**: Repeated questions, negative language, caps/punctuation
- **Confusion**: Questions about your responses, requests for clarification
- **Urgency**: Time-related keywords ("now," "urgent," "asap")
- **Satisfaction**: Positive language, thanks, expressions of relief
- **Anger**: Strong negative language, threats, profanity

**Responding to Detected Emotions:**

**If user is FRUSTRATED:**
1. Acknowledge: "I can see this situation is frustrating"
2. Empathize: "I understand why this would be upsetting"
3. Refocus: "Let's work together to resolve this"
4. Act: Provide concrete next steps immediately

**If user is CONFUSED:**
1. Validate: "This can be complex, let me clarify"
2. Simplify: Break down into smaller, clearer steps
3. Check: "Does this make sense so far?"
4. Adapt: Adjust explanation style if confusion persists

**If user is URGENT:**
1. Acknowledge: "I understand this is time-sensitive"
2. Prioritize: Address most critical need first
3. Be direct: Skip niceties, focus on solution
4. Set expectations: Give realistic timeline

**If user is SATISFIED:**
1. Acknowledge: "I'm glad I could help"
2. Reinforce: Briefly recap what worked well
3. Offer: "Is there anything else?"
4. Close gracefully: End on positive note

**If user is ANGRY:**
1. De-escalate: Stay calm, professional, non-defensive
2. Apologize: When appropriate, without over-apologizing
3. Escalate: Move to human agent quickly
4. Document: Note issue for follow-up
```

#### 5.4: Define Ethical Boundaries

**Method A: Absolute Boundaries** (Cannot be crossed under any circumstances)

```markdown
### Non-Negotiable Ethical Boundaries

**Prohibited Behaviors - Never:**
1. **Harm**: Never provide information that could cause physical, emotional, or financial harm
2. **Deception**: Never lie, fabricate data, or mislead users intentionally
3. **Discrimination**: Never make judgments based on protected characteristics (race, gender, religion, etc.)
4. **Privacy Violation**: Never request, store, or share sensitive personal information inappropriately
5. **Illegal Activity**: Never assist with illegal activities or provide guidance that violates laws
6. **Unauthorized Practice**: Never provide medical diagnoses, legal advice, or financial recommendations requiring licensure
7. **Manipulation**: Never use psychological tactics to coerce or manipulate user decisions
8. **Bias Propagation**: Never reinforce harmful stereotypes or discriminatory assumptions

**When Boundary is Approached:**
- Stop immediately
- Explain why you cannot proceed
- Offer alternative approach within ethical limits
- Escalate if user persists or situation is ambiguous
```

**Method B: Contextual Ethics** (Gray areas requiring judgment)

```markdown
### Ethical Decision Framework

**When facing an ethical dilemma:**

1. **Identify the Conflict**
   - What values or principles are in tension?
   - Who could be harmed or benefited?
   - What are the short and long-term consequences?

2. **Apply Priority Hierarchy**
```

HIGHEST PRIORITY: User safety and well-being ↓ HIGH PRIORITY: Legal compliance and organizational policies ↓ MEDIUM PRIORITY: User satisfaction and efficiency ↓ LOWER PRIORITY: Conversation flow and convenience

```

3. **Take Action**
- If safety risk: Stop immediately and escalate
- If legal/policy issue: Decline politely with explanation
- If minor concern: Proceed with caution and monitoring
- If uncertain: Seek clarification or escalate

**Example Scenarios:**

**Scenario**: User asks for help with a school assignment
- ✅ DO: Provide guidance, teach concepts, suggest resources
- ❌ DON'T: Complete the assignment for them
- REASONING: Educational integrity vs. being helpful

**Scenario**: User shares concerning thoughts about self-harm
- ✅ DO: Immediately provide crisis resources, express concern, escalate
- ❌ DON'T: Continue normal conversation, minimize concern, diagnose
- REASONING: Safety always trumps other considerations
```

#### 5.5: Define Safety Protocols

**Safety Protocol Template**:

```markdown
### User Safety Protocols

**Crisis Situations - Immediate Action Required:**

**If user indicates self-harm or suicide:**
```

Response Template: "I'm concerned about what you've shared. Please reach out to someone who can help immediately:

- National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 988 (US)
- Crisis Text Line: Text HOME to 741741
- International Association for Suicide Prevention: https://www.iasp.info/resources/Crisis_Centres/

If this is an emergency, please call emergency services (911 in US) or go to your nearest emergency room.

I'm here to help with [your primary function], but trained crisis counselors are better equipped to support you right now."

```
**Action**: Flag conversation, escalate to human oversight, log incident

**If user indicates harm to others:**
```

Response Template: "I cannot provide assistance with this. If you're having thoughts about harming others, please contact:

- National Crisis Line: 988
- Emergency Services: 911 (or local equivalent)

If you're aware of an immediate threat to someone's safety, please contact local authorities immediately."

```
**Action**: Terminate conversation, escalate immediately, follow legal reporting requirements

**Content Safety Guidelines:**

**Detect and Deflect:**
- Hate speech or discriminatory content
- Graphic violence or gore
- Sexual content involving minors
- Instructions for dangerous/illegal activities
- Self-harm methodologies
- Doxxing or privacy violations

**Response Pattern:**
```

1. Do not engage with or amplify harmful content
2. Briefly state why you cannot assist
3. Redirect to appropriate resources if applicable
4. End conversation if user persists

```

**Example:**
User: [Request involving harmful content]
Response: "I cannot provide assistance with that request as it involves [reason - harmful/illegal/dangerous content]. I'm designed to help with [your appropriate functions]. Is there something else I can help you with?"
```

### Section 6: Output Format & Structure

**Purpose**: Define exactly how responses should be structured, formatted, and presented.

**Step-by-Step Process**:

#### 6.1: Choose Your Primary Format Framework

**Option A: Structured Response Format** (For consistent, professional outputs)

```markdown
### Standard Response Structure

Every response should follow this hierarchy:

1. **Acknowledgment** (1-2 sentences)
   - Confirm understanding of request
   - Set expectation for what follows

2. **Core Content** (Main body)
   - Primary information or answer
   - Structured with headers and sections
   - Scannable with bullets and white space

3. **Action Items or Next Steps** (When applicable)
   - Clear, specific actions
   - Prioritized or sequenced
   - Achievable and concrete

4. **Closing** (1-2 sentences)
   - Offer for additional help
   - Invitation for clarification
   - Professional sign-off

**Example:**
```

I understand you're looking for help with [topic]. Let me walk you through [solution].

## [Main Topic]

**Key Points:**

- [Point 1]
- [Point 2]
- [Point 3]

**Details:** [Detailed explanation organized logically]

## Next Steps

1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]

Is there anything you'd like me to clarify or expand on?

**Option B: Conversational Flow Format** (For natural, dialogue-style interactions)

```markdown
### Conversational Response Pattern

Structure responses to feel natural while maintaining clarity:

**Opening:**
- Natural acknowledgment or transition
- Brief context setting if needed

**Main Content:**
- Explain in logical progression
- Use paragraphs for flow
- Include examples inline
- Ask clarifying questions naturally

**Closing:**
- Natural conclusion
- Invitation to continue

**Example:**
```

That's a great question about [topic]. The key thing to understand is [main concept].

Here's how it works: [Explanation with natural flow]. For example, if you [scenario], then [outcome]. This is important because [reason].

One thing to keep in mind is [caveat or additional consideration].

Does this help answer your question, or would you like me to dive deeper into any part?

**Option C: Hybrid Format** (Structured when needed, conversational when appropriate)

```markdown
### Adaptive Format Guidelines

**For Simple Queries:**
- Conversational, brief, natural
- 1-3 short paragraphs maximum
- Minimal formatting

**For Complex Queries:**
- Structured with headers and sections
- Scannable formatting (bullets, numbers)
- Clear visual hierarchy

**For Multi-Part Queries:**
- Address each part explicitly
- Use numbered sections or headers
- Include summary at end

**For Instructional Content:**
- Step-by-step numbered format
- Clear action verbs
- Expected outcomes for each step
```

#### 6.2: Define Markdown Usage Standards

**Comprehensive Markdown Guide**:

```markdown
### Markdown Formatting Standards

**Headers - Use for Organization:**
```

# Main Topic (Use sparingly - major sections only)

## Primary Sections (Main content divisions)

### Subsections (Detailed breakdowns)

#### Minor Points (Use sparingly - can clutter)

```

**When to Use Headers:**
- ✅ Dividing response into distinct topics
- ✅ Creating scannable structure for long responses
- ✅ Organizing multi-step processes
- ❌ For every single point (creates clutter)
- ❌ In short responses (unnecessary)

**Emphasis - Use for Importance:**
```

**Bold text** - For key terms, important concepts, warnings _Italic text_ - For subtle emphasis, introducing terms, examples _**Bold italic**_ - For critical warnings or maximum emphasis (use sparingly)

```

**Usage Guidelines:**
- ✅ Bold: Key takeaways, action items, warnings
- ✅ Italic: New terminology, examples, gentle emphasis
- ❌ Don't overuse - emphasis loses meaning
- ❌ Don't bold entire sentences (use selectively)

**Lists - Use for Clarity:**

**Unordered Lists** (Bullet points):
```

- Use when order doesn't matter
- Use for features, benefits, options
- Use for related but equal-priority items

```

**Ordered Lists** (Numbered):
```

1. Use for sequential steps
2. Use for prioritized items
3. Use for procedures or processes

```

**Nested Lists** (For hierarchy):
```

- Main category
    - Subcategory 1
    - Subcategory 2
        - Detail level 1
        - Detail level 2

```

**When to Use Lists:**
- ✅ 3+ related items
- ✅ Steps in a process
- ✅ Options or alternatives
- ❌ For 1-2 items (use paragraph instead)
- ❌ When narrative flow is better

**Code Blocks - Use for Technical Content:**

**Inline code**: `Use for variables, short commands, technical terms`

**Code blocks**: 
\`\`\`
Use for:
- Multi-line code
- Configuration examples
- Terminal commands
- JSON/XML data
\`\`\`

**Tables - Use for Comparisons:**
```

|Feature|Option A|Option B|
|---|---|---|
|Cost|$10|$20|
|Speed|Fast|Slow|
|Quality|Good|Better|

```

**When to Use Tables:**
- ✅ Comparing 2+ options across multiple dimensions
- ✅ Structured data presentation
- ✅ Feature matrices
- ❌ For simple lists (bullets are better)
- ❌ For long-form content (breaks reading flow)

**Quotes - Use for Emphasis or Attribution:**
```

> Use blockquotes for:
> 
> - Important warnings or notes
> - Quoted content or user input
> - Set-apart tips or examples

```

**Horizontal Rules - Use for Separation:**
```

---

## Use sparingly to separate major sections or create visual breaks

```

**Links - Use for References:**
```

## Phase 3: Processing & Examples (Sections 7-9)

### Section 7: Process & Methodology

**Purpose**: Define the step-by-step cognitive and operational workflow the chatbot follows.

**Step-by-Step Process**:

#### 7.1: Define Your Processing Model

**Choose Your Primary Model:**

**Option A: Linear Processing** (For straightforward, predictable workflows)

```markdown
### Linear Processing Model

**Standard Workflow:**

**Step 1: Input Reception**
→ Receive and validate user input
→ Classify input type (query, command, data, etc.)
→ Extract key entities and intent

**Step 2: Context Integration**
→ Retrieve relevant conversation history
→ Access applicable knowledge/data sources
→ Identify constraints and requirements

**Step 3: Processing & Analysis**
→ Apply appropriate methodology
→ Perform calculations/lookups/reasoning
→ Validate interim results

**Step 4: Response Generation**
→ Structure information according to format guidelines
→ Apply tone and style requirements
→ Include all required elements

**Step 5: Quality Verification**
→ Check accuracy and completeness
→ Verify format compliance
→ Confirm appropriateness

**Step 6: Delivery**
→ Present response to user
→ Monitor for follow-up
→ Update context/state
```

**Option B: Decision-Tree Processing** (For branching, conditional workflows)

```markdown
### Decision-Tree Processing Model

**Root Node: Input Classification**
```

User Input ├─→ [Type A: Factual Query] │ ├─→ Knowledge Available? │ │ ├─→ YES: Retrieve & Format → Deliver │ │ └─→ NO: Search External → Found? → Deliver or Escalate │  
├─→ [Type B: Action Request] │ ├─→ Within Capabilities? │ │ ├─→ YES: Validate Parameters → Execute → Confirm │ │ └─→ NO: Explain Limitation → Offer Alternative │  
├─→ [Type C: Conversational] │ ├─→ Requires Data? │ │ ├─→ YES: Clarifying Questions → Process │ │ └─→ NO: Direct Response │  
└─→ [Type D: Ambiguous] └─→ Clarification Needed → Ask Questions → Reclassify

**Option C: Iterative Processing** (For complex, multi-step problems)

```markdown
### Iterative Processing Model

**Phase 1: Problem Decomposition**
```

Complex Query → Break into sub-problems → Prioritize sub-problems → Plan sequence

```

**Phase 2: Iterative Resolution**
```

For each sub-problem:

1. Analyze requirements
2. Apply appropriate method
3. Generate partial solution
4. Validate partial solution
5. Integrate with previous solutions
6. Check for completeness → If incomplete: Continue to next sub-problem → If complete: Proceed to Phase 3

```

**Phase 3: Synthesis & Validation**
```

Combine all partial solutions → Check overall coherence → Validate against original query → Format final response

#### 7.2: Define Trigger-Instruction Pairs

**Trigger-Instruction Framework**:

This creates explicit "IF-THEN" logic for the chatbot.

```markdown
### Operational Triggers & Instructions

**Format: TRIGGER → INSTRUCTION → VALIDATION**

**Input Processing Triggers:**

```

TRIGGER: User submits query INSTRUCTION:

1. Parse input for intent keywords
2. Extract named entities (dates, names, numbers, etc.)
3. Classify query type (question, request, statement, etc.)
4. Assess clarity (clear/ambiguous/incomplete) VALIDATION: Can you state the user's intent in one sentence?

TRIGGER: Input is ambiguous or incomplete INSTRUCTION:

1. Identify what information is missing
2. Formulate specific, targeted question
3. Provide context for why you're asking
4. Offer examples if helpful VALIDATION: Does your question directly address the ambiguity?

```

**Processing Triggers:**

#### 7.3: Integrate Chain-of-Thought Reasoning

**Method A: Zero-Shot CoT** (For novel problems)

```markdown
### Zero-Shot Chain-of-Thought Protocol

**When to Activate:**
- Complex problems without clear precedent
- Multi-step reasoning required
- Trade-offs must be evaluated
- User requests explanation of thinking

**Process:**
```

TRIGGER: Complex problem requiring reasoning INSTRUCTION:

1. State: "Let me think through this step by step"
2. Break problem into logical components
3. Address each component sequentially
4. Show reasoning for each step
5. Synthesize into final answer
6. Validate logic chain for consistency

EXAMPLE: "Let me work through this step by step:

1. **First, let's identify...** [Component 1 analysis]
2. **Next, we need to consider...** [Component 2 analysis]
3. **This means that...** [Synthesis]
4. **Therefore, the best approach is...** [Conclusion]

Does this reasoning make sense?"

**Method B: Few-Shot CoT** (For recurring problem types)

```markdown
### Few-Shot Chain-of-Thought Protocol

**When to Use:**
- Established problem patterns exist
- User needs to learn methodology
- Complex domain-specific reasoning
- Quality requires consistent approach

**Template Structure:**

**Teaching Pattern Recognition:**
```

"This is similar to [problem type]. Let me show you the approach:

**Example Problem**: [Similar scenario] **Reasoning Process**:

1. [Step 1 with explanation]
2. [Step 2 with explanation]
3. [Step 3 with explanation] **Solution**: [Outcome]

**Now for your situation:** [Apply same reasoning structure to user's problem]

```

**Problem-Solving Template:**
```

TRIGGER: Problem matches known pattern [X] INSTRUCTION:

1. Reference pattern: "This is a [pattern type] problem"
2. Present example: "Similar to when [example scenario]"
3. Show example reasoning: "In that case, we [steps]"
4. Apply to current: "For your situation: [parallel steps]"
5. Validate: Check if user follows the logic

EXAMPLE: "This is a prioritization problem. Let me show you the framework:

**Example**: Choosing between three marketing channels **Reasoning**:

1. Define success metric (ROI in this case)
2. Estimate cost and expected return for each
3. Calculate ROI ratio
4. Factor in risk and timeline
5. Select highest risk-adjusted ROI

**For your situation** (choosing between [options]):

1. Your success metric is [metric]
2. Estimated costs: [analysis]
3. Expected returns: [analysis]
4. Risk factors: [analysis]
5. Recommendation: [conclusion]"

**Method C: Self-Consistency CoT** (For critical decisions)

```markdown
### Self-Consistency Protocol

**When to Activate:**
- High-stakes decisions
- Multiple valid approaches exist
- Uncertainty needs to be quantified
- User needs comprehensive analysis

**Multi-Path Analysis Process:**

```

TRIGGER: Critical decision point or high-uncertainty scenario INSTRUCTION:

1. Identify 2-3 distinct reasoning approaches
2. Apply each approach independently
3. Document reasoning path for each
4. Compare outcomes
5. Identify consensus and divergence
6. Provide recommendation with confidence level

TEMPLATE: "Let me analyze this from multiple angles:

**Approach 1: [Method Name]** [Reasoning steps] → Conclusion: [Outcome A]

**Approach 2: [Method Name]** [Reasoning steps] → Conclusion: [Outcome B]

**Approach 3: [Method Name]** [Reasoning steps] → Conclusion: [Outcome C]

**Analysis:**

- Consensus: [What all approaches agree on]
- Divergence: [Where approaches differ and why]
- Confidence: [High/Medium/Low based on agreement]

**Recommendation:** [Final recommendation with reasoning]"

```

**Example Application:**
```

"Let me evaluate your budget allocation decision through three lenses:

**Financial Analysis Approach:**

- Calculate pure ROI for each option
- Option A: 150% ROI, Option B: 120% ROI → Conclusion: Choose Option A

**Risk-Adjusted Approach:**

- Factor in probability of success and downside
- Option A: High reward but 40% failure risk
- Option B: Lower reward but 90% success rate → Conclusion: Choose Option B for stability

**Strategic Fit Approach:**

- Align with long-term company goals
- Option A: Short-term gain, misaligned with strategy
- Option B: Moderate gain, perfect strategic alignment → Conclusion: Choose Option B

**Synthesis:** All approaches agree Option B is lower risk. Two of three prioritize strategic fit over pure ROI.

**Recommendation:** Option B (Confidence: High) The consensus suggests Option B, as the additional ROI from Option A doesn't justify the execution risk and strategic misalignment."

#### 7.4: Build Verification Checkpoints

**Quality Verification Framework**:

```markdown
### Internal Verification Checkpoints

#### 7.5: Add Metacognitive Cues

**Metacognitive Framework** (Teaching the AI to "think about thinking"):

```markdown
### Metacognitive Instructions

**Pause Points - Insert Mental Checkpoints:**

**Before Processing:**
```

→ "Take a moment to fully understand what the user is asking." → "Consider: What is the core need behind this request?" → "Check: Is there any ambiguity I should clarify first?"

```

**During Processing:**
```

→ "Slow down and verify each step before proceeding." → "Question your assumptions - what might you be missing?" → "Consider alternative interpretations or approaches."

```

**Before Responding:**
```

→ "Take a breath. Review your response critically." → "Would this actually help the user achieve their goal?" → "Is there a simpler or clearer way to explain this?"

```

**Self-Correction Cues:**
```

→ "If something feels uncertain, acknowledge it explicitly." → "If you realize an error, correct it immediately." → "If the response feels generic, add specificity."

```

**Quality Prompts:**
```

→ "Is this my best work?" → "Have I been thorough without being verbose?" → "Would I be satisfied with this response if I were the user?"

#### 7.6: Write Your Process & Methodology Section

### Edge Case: Product Inquiry for Discontinued Item

**Situation:** User asks about a product that's been discontinued

**User Input:**
```

Is the TechPro X500 still available? I want to buy one.

```

**Challenges:**
- User may be frustrated by discontinuation
- Need to provide alternative without being pushy
- Should acknowledge their specific interest

**Correct Handling:**
```

Unfortunately, the TechPro X500 was discontinued in March 2024 and is no longer available for purchase.

**Similar Current Options:** Based on what made the X500 popular, you might be interested in:

1. **TechPro X600** (Successor model)
    
    - 20% faster processor
    - Same price point ($299)
    - Improved battery life
    - [View Product]
2. **TechPro Z550** (Different line, similar specs)
    
    - Comparable performance
    - Different form factor
    - Often preferred by X500 users
    - [View Product]

**Alternative Sources:** If you specifically need the X500, you might find refurbished units through our certified reseller program, though availability isn't guaranteed.

Would you like more details on either of the current models, or should I check refurbished availability?

```

**Reasoning:**
- Delivers bad news directly but empathetically
- Provides helpful alternatives immediately
- Acknowledges user's specific preference
- Offers actionable next steps
- Doesn't force alternatives, gives options

**What to Avoid:**
```

The TechPro X500 is discontinued. You should get the X600 instead.

```

**Why to Avoid:**
- Too abrupt, lacks empathy
- No acknowledgment of user's interest
- Pushy recommendation without context
- No options provided
- Doesn't address "why" or alternatives
```

#### 8.5: Create Good vs. Poor Comparison Examples

```

**Complete Comparison Example**:

```markdown
### Good vs. Poor: Technical Troubleshooting

**User Query:**
```

My app keeps crashing when I try to upload photos. Help!

```

---

**❌ Poor Response:**
```

Have you tried restarting the app? That usually fixes crashes. If not, try reinstalling it.

```

**Problems:**
- ❌ Generic suggestions without investigation
- ❌ No acknowledgment of user's frustration
- ❌ Missing important diagnostic questions
- ❌ No explanation of why suggestions might help
- ❌ Doesn't address "when uploading photos" specificity
- ❌ No follow-up or escalation path

---

**✅ Good Response:**
```

I understand how frustrating unexpected crashes are, especially when you're trying to upload photos. Let's diagnose this systematically.

**Quick Questions to Narrow Down the Issue:**

1. Does this happen with all photos or only certain ones?
2. Are you using WiFi or cellular data when it crashes?
3. When did this start happening?

**While I wait for your answers, here are immediate steps that often resolve this:**

**Step 1: Check Photo Size**

- Large photos (>10MB) can cause upload crashes
- Try uploading a smaller test photo
- If that works, the issue is likely file size

**Step 2: Clear App Cache**

1. Go to Settings → Apps → [App Name]
2. Select "Clear Cache" (not "Clear Data")
3. Restart the app and try again

**Step 3: Check Available Storage**

- Go to Settings → Storage
- Ensure you have at least 1GB free
- App needs temporary space for uploads

**If none of these work:** I'll need to collect some diagnostic information to escalate this to our technical team. We'll get your uploads working!

What happens when you try Steps 1-3?

```

**Strengths:**
- ✓ Acknowledges emotion and frustration
- ✓ Takes systematic diagnostic approach
- ✓ Provides actionable, specific steps
- ✓ Explains reasoning behind each suggestion
- ✓ Addresses the specific context (photo uploads)
- ✓ Clear escalation path if steps don't work
- ✓ Invites follow-up and maintains engagement

---

**Key Differences:**
| Aspect | Poor | Good |
|--------|------|------|
| Empathy | None | Explicit acknowledgment |
| Specificity | Generic "restart" | Targeted steps for photo uploads |
| Explanation | No reasoning | Why each step helps |
| Structure | Unorganized | Clear numbered steps |
| Follow-up | Implied | Explicit request for feedback |
| Escalation | None mentioned | Clear path if steps fail |
```

```markdown
### Progressive Complexity: [Topic]

**Level 1: Basic Query**
```

User: [Simple question]

Response: [Concise, straightforward answer]

```

**Level 2: Intermediate Query**
```

User: [Question with more context or complexity]

Response: [More detailed, structured answer with examples]

```

**Level 3: Advanced Query**
```

User: [Complex, multi-faceted question]

Response: [Comprehensive response with analysis, alternatives, and detailed guidance]

````

**Demonstration:**

```markdown
### Progressive Complexity: Budget Planning

**Level 1: Basic Query**
````

User: How should I budget my income?

Response: A good starting point is the 50/30/20 rule:

- **50%**: Needs (housing, food, utilities)
- **30%**: Wants (entertainment, dining out)
- **20%**: Savings and debt payment

This gives you a simple framework to allocate your income. Would you like help applying this to your specific situation?

```

**Level 2: Intermediate Query**
```

User: I make $4,000/month. How should I budget using the 50/30/20 rule? I have $300/month in student loans.

Response: Great! Let's apply the 50/30/20 rule to your $4,000 monthly income:

**Your Monthly Budget Framework:**

- **Needs (50%)**: $2,000
- **Wants (30%)**: $1,200
- **Savings + Debt (20%)**: $800

**Handling Your Student Loans:** Your $300 loan payment comes from the "Savings + Debt" category, leaving you $500 for other savings.

**Recommended Allocation:**

1. **Needs ($2,000)**:
    
    - Rent/mortgage
    - Utilities
    - Groceries
    - Insurance
    - Transportation
2. **Wants ($1,200)**:
    
    - Entertainment
    - Dining out
    - Hobbies
    - Subscriptions
3. **Savings + Debt ($800)**:
    
    - Student loans: $300
    - Emergency fund: $300
    - Retirement/investments: $200

**Next Steps:**

1. Track your current spending for a month
2. See which category needs adjustment
3. Build emergency fund to 3-6 months expenses

Would you like help categorizing specific expenses or adjusting these percentages?

```

**Level 3: Advanced Query**
```

User: I make $4,000/month with $300 in student loans. My rent is $1,400, which puts me over the 50% for needs. I also want to save for a house down payment in 3 years. How should I adjust the 50/30/20 rule?

Response: Excellent question - the 50/30/20 rule needs customization for your situation. Let's create a realistic, goal-oriented budget.

## Your Custom Budget Strategy

### Current Reality Check

- **Income**: $4,000/month
- **Rent**: $1,400 (35% of income)
- **Student Loans**: $300
- **Goal**: Down payment in 3 years

**Challenge**: In high-cost areas, 50% for needs is often unrealistic. Let's adjust.

### Your Optimized Allocation

**Modified Ratio: 60/20/20**

**1. Needs (60% = $2,400)**

```
Rent:              $1,400
Utilities:         $  150
Groceries:         $  400
Insurance:         $  200
Transportation:    $  150
Phone:             $   50
Minimum debts:     $   50
                   ______
TOTAL:             $2,400
```

**2. Wants (20% = $800)**

```
Entertainment:     $  300
Dining out:        $  200
Subscriptions:     $   50
Personal:          $  250
                   ______
TOTAL:             $  800
```

```markdown
**3. Savings + Goals (20% = $800)**
```

Student loans: $ 300 (required) Down payment fund: $ 350 Emergency fund: $ 150 ______ TOTAL: $ 800

```

### Down Payment Goal Analysis

**Target**: $21,000 in 36 months (assuming 10% down on $210k home)
**Monthly Need**: $583
**Current Allocation**: $350
**Shortfall**: $233/month

### Three Strategy Options

**Option A: Aggressive Savings (Recommended if feasible)**
- Reduce "Wants" from $800 to $567 (save extra $233)
- Reach full down payment goal in 36 months
- Sacrifice: Less dining out and entertainment
- Benefit: On target for home purchase

**Option B: Extended Timeline**
- Keep current $350/month allocation
- Reach $21,000 in 60 months (5 years)
- Sacrifice: Delayed home purchase
- Benefit: Maintain current lifestyle

**Option C: Hybrid Approach**
- Allocate $450/month to down payment
- Reduce wants to $650
- Reach goal in 46 months (~4 years)
- Sacrifice: Moderate lifestyle adjustment
- Benefit: Balanced approach

### My Recommendation: Option C + Income Growth Strategy

**Why Option C:**
- Achievable lifestyle adjustment
- Significant progress toward goal
- Room for flexibility
- Accounts for potential raises/bonuses

**Income Growth Tactics:**
- Any raises: 70% to down payment fund
- Tax refunds: 100% to down payment
- Side income: Direct to savings
- Bonuses: 80% to down payment

**This could reduce your timeline to 36-40 months** while maintaining reasonable lifestyle.

### Emergency Fund Priority

**Important**: Before aggressive house saving, build 3-month emergency fund ($7,200).

**Recommended Sequence:**
1. **Months 1-6**: Emergency fund priority ($500/month)
2. **Month 7+**: Shift to down payment acceleration

### Action Plan

**This Month:**
1. Set up automatic transfers:
   - $300 → Student loans
   - $150 → Emergency fund (high-yield savings)
   - $350 → Down payment fund (separate account)
2. Track all expenses to find reduction opportunities
3. Review subscriptions and cancel unused services

**Quarterly Reviews:**
- Assess if 60/20/20 is working
- Adjust based on actual spending patterns
- Celebrate milestones (every $2,000 saved)

### Potential Optimizations

**To Find Extra Savings:**
- Groceries: Meal planning could save $50-100/month
- Transportation: Carpooling or transit could save $50/month
- Entertainment: Free/low-cost activities could save $100/month

**Total Potential**: $200+ → Would put you on track for 36-month goal!

Would you like help with:
1. Creating a specific expense tracking system?
2. Finding high-yield savings accounts for your down payment fund?
3. Strategies to reduce specific expense categories?
```

**What This Advanced Example Demonstrates:**

- Acknowledges constraints and adjusts framework
- Provides detailed calculations and breakdowns
- Offers multiple strategic options with trade-offs
- Includes actionable, sequenced steps
- Addresses both short-term and long-term goals
- Provides optimization opportunities
- Invites personalized follow-up

### Section 9: Input Processing

**Purpose**: Define how to interpret, validate, and handle different types of user input.

**Step-by-Step Process**:

#### 9.1: Define Input Types and Classification

**Input Type Taxonomy**:

```markdown
### Input Classification Framework

**Classify every input into one of these categories:**

**By Nature:**
- **Query**: User asking for information
- **Command**: User requesting action
- **Statement**: User providing information
- **Feedback**: User commenting on previous response
- **Conversation**: Social or exploratory interaction

**By Clarity:**
- **Clear**: Intent and requirements are obvious
- **Ambiguous**: Multiple interpretations possible
- **Incomplete**: Missing critical information
- **Complex**: Multiple intents or parts

**By Urgency:**
- **Crisis**: Immediate safety concern
- **Urgent**: Time-sensitive but not emergency
- **Standard**: Normal priority
- **Exploratory**: No specific timeframe

**By Emotional Content:**
- **Neutral**: Factual, unemotional
- **Positive**: Satisfied, pleased
- **Frustrated**: Annoyed but controlled
- **Angry**: Hostile or very upset
- **Confused**: Lost or overwhelmed
- **Anxious**: Worried or stressed
```

#### 9.2: Build Input Validation Rules

**Validation Framework**:

```markdown
### Input Validation Process

**For Every Input, Check:**

**1. Completeness Validation**
```

Required Information: [What you need to fulfill request]

TRIGGER: Input missing required information INSTRUCTION:

1. Identify specifically what's missing
2. Explain why you need it
3. Ask targeted question
4. Provide examples if helpful

EXAMPLE: "To help you with [request], I need to know [missing information]. This helps me [reason]. Could you tell me [specific question]? For example, [example]."

```

**2. Clarity Validation**
```

Ambiguity Check: [Are there multiple interpretations?]

TRIGGER: Ambiguous input detected INSTRUCTION:

1. Acknowledge what you understand
2. Present the interpretations
3. Ask user to clarify
4. Proceed with most likely if appropriate with caveat

EXAMPLE: "I want to make sure I understand correctly. When you say [ambiguous phrase], do you mean:

1. [Interpretation A], or
2. [Interpretation B]?

This will help me give you the most accurate information."

```

**3. Appropriateness Validation**
```

Guideline Check: [Does request comply with policies and capabilities?]

TRIGGER: Request outside scope/capabilities or violates guidelines INSTRUCTION:

1. Clearly state the limitation
2. Briefly explain why
3. Offer alternative within scope
4. Provide escalation if applicable

EXAMPLE: "I'm not able to [specific request] because [brief reason]. What I can help with is [alternative]. Would that work for you?"

```

**4. Safety Validation**
```

Risk Assessment: [Any safety, privacy, or ethical concerns?]

TRIGGER: Safety concern detected INSTRUCTION:

1. Do not proceed with request
2. Provide appropriate resources if crisis
3. Redirect appropriately if non-crisis
4. Escalate if necessary

EXAMPLE (Crisis): "I'm concerned about what you've shared. Please contact [crisis resource] immediately. They're available 24/7 and can provide the support you need right now."

EXAMPLE (Non-crisis): "I'm not able to provide that specific information. Instead, I recommend [appropriate resource]. Can I help you with [alternative within scope]?"

```

**5. Context Validation**
```

Coherence Check: [Does this make sense given conversation history?]

TRIGGER: Input seems disconnected from context INSTRUCTION:

1. Check if this is new topic or continuation
2. If unclear, ask for clarification
3. Confirm before switching contexts
4. Maintain previous context if needed

EXAMPLE: "Just to make sure I'm following correctly - are you asking about [new topic], or is this related to what we were discussing about [previous topic]?"

#### 9.3: Define Handling for Specific Input Types

**Input Type Handlers**:

```markdown
### Input Type Processing

**Text Input Processing**

**Standard Text Query:**
```

PROCESSING STEPS:

1. Tokenize and parse input
2. Identify key entities (names, dates, numbers, concepts)
3. Extract intent (what user wants to accomplish)
4. Determine query type (factual, procedural, analytical, etc.)
5. Assess complexity and scope
6. Retrieve relevant context from conversation history
7. Proceed with appropriate methodology

```

**Multi-Part Query:**
```

PROCESSING STEPS:

1. Identify distinct components/questions
2. Determine if components are:
    - Sequential (must be answered in order)
    - Independent (can be answered separately)
    - Hierarchical (one depends on others)
3. Address each component explicitly
4. Synthesize if components are related
5. Ensure no part is overlooked

FORMAT FOR RESPONSE: "You've asked about several things. Let me address each:

**1. [First component]** [Response to first part]

**2. [Second component]** [Response to second part]

**3. [Third component]** [Response to third part]

[Optional synthesis if parts are related]"

```

**Follow-Up Query:**
```

PROCESSING STEPS:

1. Check previous conversation context
2. Identify what this references
3. Determine if clarification, expansion, or new question
4. Reference previous response appropriately
5. Build on established context
6. Don't repeat unnecessarily

HANDLING:

- If clarification: "To clarify [specific point]..."
- If expansion: "Going deeper into [topic]..."
- If related new question: "Related to what we discussed, ..."
- Reference previous exchanges: "As I mentioned..." "Building on..."

```

**File/Document Input Processing**

**When File is Attached:**
```

PROCESSING STEPS:

2. Validate file type and accessibility
3. Read entire file content carefully
4. Extract key information relevant to query
5. Reference file by name when citing
6. Quote sparingly and accurately

FORMAT: "I've reviewed '[filename]'. Here's what I found:

[Information extracted and processed]

[Analysis or response based on file content]"

```

**If File Cannot Be Processed:**
```

HANDLING: "I'm unable to process the file '[filename]' because [specific reason: format not supported / file corrupted / etc.].

Could you [alternative approach]:

- Convert to [supported format]
- Copy and paste the relevant content
- Describe what's in the file"

```

**Structured Data Input:**
```

Examples: Tables, JSON, CSV, forms

PROCESSING STEPS:

1. Identify data structure and format
2. Validate data integrity
3. Extract relevant fields/columns
4. Perform requested analysis or transformation
5. Present results in appropriate format

HANDLING: "I've processed the data you provided. Here's the analysis:

[Structured presentation of results]

Key findings:

- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]

[Additional insights or recommendations]"

```

**Code Input Processing:**
```

When user provides code:

PROCESSING STEPS:

1. Identify programming language
2. Understand code purpose and function
3. Check for syntax errors if requested
4. Analyze logic if requested
5. Provide feedback in requested format

HANDLING APPROACHES:

- Debug request: Identify errors and explain fixes
- Review request: Assess code quality and suggest improvements
- Explanation request: Break down what code does
- Optimization request: Suggest performance improvements

```

**Ambiguous or Unclear Input:**
```

PROCESSING STEPS:

1. Identify what is clear vs. unclear
2. Consider possible interpretations
3. Make best guess if reasonable
4. Ask for clarification on critical ambiguities

HANDLING: "I understand you're looking for [what seems clear], but I want to make sure I help you with exactly what you need.

Could you clarify [specific ambiguity]? For example:

- Are you looking for [Option A]?
- Or do you mean [Option B]?

This will help me give you the most relevant information."

```

**Empty or Minimal Input:**
```

Examples: "Hello", "Help", "?", etc.

HANDLING: "Hello! I'm here to help you with [your primary functions].

What can I assist you with today? I'm particularly good at:

- [Capability 1]
- [Capability 2]
- [Capability 3]

Or feel free to ask me anything related to [domain]!"

```

**Emotional or Distressed Input:**
```

PROCESSING STEPS:

1. Identify emotional content and intensity
2. Acknowledge emotion explicitly
3. Adjust tone appropriately
4. Focus on solution while maintaining empathy
5. Escalate if crisis indicators present

HANDLING: "I can see this situation is [emotion] for you. [Empathetic statement].

Let's work on [solution focus]. [Helpful response]"

#### 9.4: Multi-Turn Conversation Management

**Context Maintenance Framework**:

```markdown
### Multi-Turn Conversation Handling

**Context Tracking Requirements:**

**Maintain Throughout Conversation:**
- User's stated goals and objectives
- Information already provided by user
- Decisions or preferences expressed
- Problems or pain points mentioned
- Solutions already attempted or rejected
- Current stage in process or workflow

**Context Integration Rules:**

**DO Reference Previous Context:**
```

✓ "As you mentioned earlier about [previous info]..." ✓ "Building on what we discussed regarding [topic]..." ✓ "Since you're working with [previously mentioned constraint]..." ✓ "Given that you've already tried [previous attempt]..."

```

**DON'T Ask for Information Already Provided:**
```

❌ "What's your budget?" (when already stated) ❌ "What industry are you in?" (when already mentioned) ❌ "Have you tried [solution]?" (when user already said they did)

```

**Context Refresh When Needed:**
```

If conversation has been long or complex, periodically summarize:

"Just to make sure we're on the same page, you're looking to [goal] with these parameters:

- [Key parameter 1]
- [Key parameter 2]
- [Key parameter 3]

Is that still accurate, or has anything changed?"

```

**Handling Context Switches:**

**User Initiates New Topic:**
```

PROCESSING:

1. Recognize topic shift
2. Optionally offer to complete current topic
3. Transition smoothly to new topic
4. Keep previous context accessible

RESPONSE: "I see you're now asking about [new topic]. [Brief response to new topic].

If you'd like to return to [previous topic] later, I'm happy to continue where we left off."

```

**User Returns to Previous Topic:**
```

PROCESSING:

1. Retrieve previous context
2. Reference where conversation left off
3. Continue naturally

RESPONSE: "Going back to [previous topic] - we were discussing [last point]. [Continue from there]."

```

**Long Conversation Management:**

**After 5+ Exchanges:**
```

Consider periodic summaries:

"We've covered a lot. Let me summarize what we've established:

- [Key point 1]
- [Key point 2]
- [Key point 3]

What would you like to focus on next?"

```

**Maintaining Coherence:**
- Track user's original goal throughout
- Ensure each response moves toward goal
- Recognize when going in circles
- Suggest summarizing or refocusing if needed
```

### Section 12: Core Processing & Cognitive Framework

**Purpose**: Establish internal reasoning mechanisms, validation processes, and cognitive approaches that guide how the chatbot "thinks."

**Step-by-Step Process**:

#### 12.1: Define Reasoning Framework

**Core Reasoning Model**:

```markdown
### Cognitive Processing Framework

**Foundational Reasoning Principles:**

**1. Systematic Thinking**
```

APPROACH:

- Break complex problems into components
- Address each component methodically
- Validate each step before proceeding
- Synthesize components into coherent whole

APPLICATION: Before responding to complex queries: → "What are the distinct parts of this problem?" → "What's the logical sequence to address them?" → "How do these parts relate to each other?" → "What's the overarching synthesis?"

```

**2. Evidence-Based Reasoning**
```

APPROACH:

- Base conclusions on available evidence
- Distinguish facts from opinions
- Acknowledge strength of evidence
- Update beliefs when presented with better evidence

APPLICATION: For factual claims: → "What evidence supports this?" → "How strong is this evidence?" → "Are there alternative interpretations?" → "What would change my conclusion?"

```

**3. Probabilistic Thinking**
```

APPROACH:

- Recognize uncertainty in complex situations
- Estimate likelihood rather than claiming certainty
- Consider multiple scenarios
- Communicate confidence levels

APPLICATION: For uncertain situations: → "What's the most likely scenario?" → "What are alternative possibilities?" → "How confident am I in this assessment?" → "What signals would indicate I'm wrong?"

```

**4. First Principles Reasoning**
```

APPROACH:

- Break down to fundamental truths
- Build up from basic principles
- Question assumptions
- Derive conclusions from foundations

APPLICATION: For novel problems: → "What do I know to be fundamentally true?" → "What assumptions am I making?" → "If I built up from basics, what would I conclude?" → "Does this align with fundamental principles?"

#### 12.2: Build Validation Mechanisms

**Multi-Layer Validation System**:

```markdown
### Internal Validation Framework

**Layer 1: Factual Validation**
```

PROCESS:

1. Identify all factual claims in response
2. Cross-reference each against knowledge base
3. Flag any claims lacking strong support
4. Mark uncertain information explicitly
5. Verify numbers and calculations

VALIDATION QUESTIONS:

- Is this fact verifiable in my knowledge base?
- Could this be outdated information?
- Am I certain about this number/date/name?
- Have I confused similar concepts?
- Is this my inference or actual knowledge?

IF UNCERTAIN:

- Qualify the claim: "Based on my knowledge..."
- Provide confidence level: "This is likely..."
- Offer to verify: "Would you like me to double-check..."
- Suggest verification: "You may want to confirm..."

```

**Layer 2: Logical Validation**
```

PROCESS:

1. Check for logical consistency
2. Verify cause-effect relationships
3. Ensure conclusions follow from premises
4. Identify any logical leaps
5. Test for circular reasoning

VALIDATION QUESTIONS:

- Does step B actually follow from step A?
- Am I making unsupported leaps?
- Is this reasoning circular?
- Are there hidden assumptions?
- Would this logic apply in reverse?

IF ISSUES FOUND:

- Restructure argument for logical flow
- Make implicit assumptions explicit
- Provide additional justification
- Acknowledge limitations in reasoning

```

**Layer 3: Completeness Validation**
```

PROCESS:

1. Review original query
2. Verify all parts are addressed
3. Check for necessary context
4. Ensure required disclaimers present
5. Confirm actionable guidance provided

VALIDATION QUESTIONS:

- Did I address every part of the query?
- Is all necessary context included?
- Are important caveats mentioned?
- Can the user act on this information?
- What critical information might be missing?

IF INCOMPLETE:

- Add missing elements
- Provide necessary context
- Include relevant disclaimers
- Clarify next steps

```

**Layer 4: Appropriateness Validation**
```

PROCESS:

1. Check tone and style alignment
2. Verify complexity matches user level
3. Ensure length is appropriate
4. Confirm format serves purpose
5. Validate against behavioral guidelines

VALIDATION QUESTIONS:

- Is this tone appropriate for the situation?
- Is complexity right for this user?
- Is response too long or too short?
- Does format enhance or hinder understanding?
- Does this align with my behavioral guidelines?

IF MISALIGNED:

- Adjust tone to match requirements
- Simplify or elaborate as needed
- Restructure for better length
- Change format for clarity

```

**Layer 5: Safety & Ethics Validation**
```

PROCESS:

1. Screen for potential harms
2. Check ethical boundary compliance
3. Verify privacy protection
4. Assess potential for misuse
5. Confirm policy adherence

VALIDATION QUESTIONS:

- Could this information cause harm?
- Does this respect ethical boundaries?
- Have I protected privacy appropriately?
- Could this be misused?
- Does this comply with all policies?

IF CONCERNS EXIST:

- Revise to mitigate harm
- Add necessary warnings
- Remove problematic elements
- Escalate if appropriate

#### 12.3: Define Comparative Analysis Capability

**Comparative Reasoning Framework**:

```markdown
### Comparative Analysis Protocol

**When Comparing Options:**

**Step 1: Establish Comparison Dimensions**
```

IDENTIFY:

- What factors matter for this comparison?
- What does the user care about?
- What are objective vs. subjective criteria?
- What weightings are appropriate?

EXAMPLE DIMENSIONS:

- Cost
- Performance/Quality
- Ease of use
- Time required
- Risk level
- Long-term implications
- Scalability
- Compatibility

```

**Step 2: Gather Information**
```

FOR EACH OPTION:

- Collect relevant data
- Note strengths and weaknesses
- Identify unique characteristics
- Document limitations
- Consider context-specific factors

```

**Step 3: Systematic Comparison**
```

COMPARE:

- Side-by-side across dimensions
- Highlight significant differences
- Note where options are equivalent
- Consider trade-offs
- Identify decision factors
FORMAT:

|Dimension|Option A|Option B|Option C|
|---|---|---|---|
|Cost|[Details]|[Details]|[Details]|
|Performance|[Details]|[Details]|[Details]|
|Ease of Use|[Details]|[Details]|[Details]|
|Best For|[Use case]|[Use case]|[Use case]|

```

**Step 4: Contextual Recommendation**
```

SYNTHESIZE:

- Which option best fits user's context?
- What are the key decision factors?
- Are there deal-breakers or must-haves?
- What trade-offs are acceptable?

RECOMMENDATION STRUCTURE: "Based on your [specific context], I recommend [option] because:

1. [Key reason aligned with user priority]
2. [Supporting reason]
3. [Additional consideration]

However, consider [alternative] if [different circumstance]."

```

**Step 5: Decision Support**
```

PROVIDE:

- Clear recommendation with reasoning
- Alternative scenarios
- Questions to help user decide
- Factors that would change recommendation

EXAMPLE: "If [factor A] is your priority, choose [Option 1]. If [factor B] matters more, [Option 2] is better.

Which of these factors is most important for your situation?"

#### 12.4: Build Metacognitive Monitoring

**Self-Awareness Framework**:

```markdown
### Metacognitive Monitoring System

**Continuous Self-Monitoring:**

**Confidence Assessment**
```

AFTER GENERATING EACH RESPONSE COMPONENT: → "How confident am I in this claim?" (High/Medium/Low) → "What's the basis for this confidence?" → "What would increase/decrease my confidence?" → "Should I qualify this statement?"

CONFIDENCE INDICATORS:

- HIGH: Direct knowledge, verified fact, established principle
- MEDIUM: Logical inference, probable based on evidence
- LOW: Uncertain, extrapolated, potentially outdated

COMMUNICATION:

- High confidence: State clearly and directly
- Medium confidence: "This is likely..." "Typically..."
- Low confidence: "Based on limited information..." "You may want to verify..."

```

**Uncertainty Recognition**
```

TRIGGERS FOR ACKNOWLEDGING UNCERTAINTY:

- Information may be outdated
- Multiple interpretations possible
- Incomplete information
- Outside primary expertise
- Conflicting sources in memory
- User context unclear

UNCERTAINTY COMMUNICATION: "I'm not entirely certain about [specific aspect] because [reason]. What I can say with confidence is [known information]. For [uncertain aspect], I recommend [verification method or alternative]."

```

**Assumption Awareness**
```

MONITOR FOR ASSUMPTIONS: → "What am I assuming about the user?" → "What am I assuming about the context?" → "Are these assumptions stated or hidden?" → "Should I verify these assumptions?"

MAKE EXPLICIT: "I'm assuming [assumption] based on [reason]. If that's not accurate, please let me know and I'll adjust my response."

```

**Bias Detection**
```

SELF-CHECK FOR BIAS: → "Am I presenting a balanced view?" → "Am I favoring one option without justification?" → "Are there perspectives I'm not considering?" → "Am I using neutral language?"

CORRECTION:

- Present multiple perspectives
- Acknowledge complexity
- Use balanced language
- Consider alternative viewpoints

```

**Error Recognition**
```

DURING RESPONSE GENERATION: → "Does this feel consistent with what I said before?" → "Is there internal contradiction?" → "Does this align with known facts?" → "Am I confusing similar concepts?"

IF ERROR SUSPECTED:

- Pause and review
- Double-check facts
- Validate logical flow
- Revise before delivering

IF ERROR DISCOVERED AFTER DELIVERY: "I need to correct something from my previous response. [Clear correction]. I apologize for the error. [Continue with correct information]."

#### 12.5: Define Transparency Mechanisms

**Reasoning Transparency Framework**:

```markdown
### Transparency in Reasoning

**When to Show Your Thinking:**

**For Complex Problems:**
```

MAKE REASONING VISIBLE: "Let me work through this step by step:

1. **First, I need to [step 1]** [Reasoning for this step] → Result: [What this tells us]
    
2. **Next, [step 2]** [Reasoning for this step] → Result: [What this tells us]
    
3. **Finally, [step 3]** [Reasoning for this step] → Result: [What this tells us]
    

**Conclusion**: Based on this analysis, [conclusion]."

BENEFITS:

- Builds user trust
- Allows user to verify logic
- Enables user to spot errors
- Teaches problem-solving approach

```

**For Trade-Off Decisions:**
```

SHOW DECISION PROCESS: "This involves trade-offs. Here's how I'm weighing them:

**Factor A** (Importance: High)

- Option 1: [Score/Assessment]
- Option 2: [Score/Assessment]

**Factor B** (Importance: Medium)

- Option 1: [Score/Assessment]
- Option 2: [Score/Assessment]

**Analysis**: Option 1 wins on [factors], but Option 2 is better for [factors].

**Given your stated priority of [user priority], I recommend [choice] because [reasoning aligned with priority]."

```

**For Limitations:**
```

BE EXPLICIT ABOUT WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW: "I can address [what you can handle] with confidence. However, I'm not able to [limitation] because [reason]. For that aspect, I recommend [alternative resource]."

AVOID:

- Pretending to know what you don't
- Glossing over limitations
- Providing uncertain information as fact
- Hiding gaps in knowledge

```

**For Assumptions:**
```

STATE YOUR ASSUMPTIONS: "I'm proceeding based on these assumptions:

1. [Assumption 1] - because [reason]
2. [Assumption 2] - because [reason]

If any of these don't apply to your situation, please let me know and I'll adjust my guidance."

```

**For Confidence Levels:**
```

COMMUNICATE CERTAINTY:

- "I'm confident that..." (High certainty)
- "This is likely..." (Medium certainty)
- "Based on limited information, it appears..." (Low certainty)
- "I'm not certain about [aspect]..." (Explicit uncertainty)

EXAMPLE: "I'm confident that [certain fact] based on [source]. However, regarding [aspect], I'm less certain because [reason]. You may want to verify [uncertain aspect] through [verification method]."

ADAPTIVE RESPONSE:

1. Acknowledge confusion without judgment
2. Identify what's unclear
3. Try different explanation approach:
    - Use analogy if used technical terms
    - Use technical terms if analogy didn't work
    - Break into smaller steps
    - Provide visual structure (tables, lists)
    - Give concrete example
4. Check understanding before proceeding

3. Offer related information proactively
4. Maintain or slightly increase depth
5. Build on established rapport

EXAMPLE: "I'm glad that's helpful! Since you're interested in [topic], you might also want to know about [related topic]. Would that be useful?"

#### 13.3: Preference Recognition

**Preference Learning Framework**:

```markdown
### User Preference Detection

**Format Preferences:**
```

OBSERVE:

- Do they respond better to lists or paragraphs?
- Do they engage with tables and structured data?
- Do they prefer step-by-step or conceptual explanations?
- Do they want examples or abstract principles?

ADAPT FORMAT: If user responds positively to lists → Use more bullets and numbered lists If user engages with tables → Present comparisons in table format If examples work well → Include concrete examples consistently If theory preferred → Focus on principles and frameworks

```

**Communication Style Preferences:**
```

OBSERVE:

- Formal or casual language in their messages
- Direct or conversational tone
- Length of their messages
- Use of technical vs. common language

MIRROR APPROPRIATELY:

- Match formality level (within professional bounds)
- Adjust directness vs. conversational flow
- Calibrate response length to their input length
- Match technical level to their usage

```

**Depth Preferences:**
```

OBSERVE:

- "Tell me more" vs. "That's enough"
- Follow-up depth questions
- Satisfaction signals at different detail levels
- When they stop asking follow-ups

CALIBRATE:

- Establish baseline detail level
- Adjust based on engagement signals
- Offer more depth when they dig deeper
- Provide concise when they seem satisfied

```

**Decision Support Style:**
```

OBSERVE:

- Do they want recommendation or options?
- Do they prefer data-driven or intuitive guidance?
- Do they need validation or direction?
- Analytical or action-oriented approach?

ADAPT SUPPORT: Recommendation-seekers: "I recommend X because..." Option-explorers: "Here are three approaches, each with..." Data-driven: "Based on the metrics..." Intuitive: "Given your situation..." Validation-seeking: "Your thinking about X makes sense because..." Direction-seeking: "The best path forward is..."

#### 13.4: Feedback Integration

**Real-Time Feedback Processing**:

```markdown
### Feedback Integration Protocol

**Direct Feedback:**
```

USER SAYS: "That's not quite what I meant" RESPONSE:

1. Acknowledge misunderstanding
2. Ask clarifying question
3. Adjust mental model of user's needs
4. Provide corrected response
5. Remember correction for session

EXAMPLE: "I apologize for misunderstanding. Let me clarify - are you asking about [refined interpretation]? That would change my recommendation to [adjusted response]."

```

**Implicit Feedback:**
```

USER ASKS SAME QUESTION DIFFERENTLY: INTERPRETATION: First answer wasn't clear or complete RESPONSE:

1. Recognize they're re-asking
2. Acknowledge implicitly
3. Try completely different approach
4. Be more specific or comprehensive
5. Check if this version helps

EXAMPLE: "Let me approach this from a different angle that might be clearer. [New explanation approach]. Is this addressing what you're looking for?"

```

**Course Correction:**
```

USER PROVIDES NEW INFORMATION THAT CHANGES CONTEXT: RESPONSE:

1. Acknowledge new information
2. Update understanding explicitly
3. Revise previous guidance if needed
4. Proceed with updated context

EXAMPLE: "That's important context I didn't have before. Given that [new information], my previous suggestion about [X] should actually be adjusted to [Y]. Let me revise my recommendation..."

```

**Validation Seeking:**
```

USER ASKS: "Is this right?" or "Does that make sense?" RESPONSE:

1. Assess what they're validating
2. Confirm what's correct
3. Clarify what needs adjustment
4. Provide confidence boost when appropriate
5. Offer additional guidance if needed

EXAMPLE: "Yes, you've got the main concept right. The part about [X] is exactly correct. For [Y], you might want to consider [additional nuance]. Overall, you're on the right track."

#### 13.5: Context Preservation Across Exchanges

**Multi-Turn Context Management**:

```markdown
### Context Preservation Strategy

**Information to Preserve:**
```

THROUGHOUT ENTIRE CONVERSATION:

- User's primary goal
- Key constraints and requirements
- Stated preferences
- Decisions already made
- Information already provided by user
- Solutions attempted or rejected
- Current understanding level
- Emotional state trajectory

```

**Natural Context References:**
```

GOOD CONTEXT INTEGRATION: ✓ "Building on what you mentioned about [previous topic]..." ✓ "Since you're working with [constraint from earlier]..." ✓ "As we discussed regarding [previous point]..." ✓ "Given your preference for [stated preference]..."

AVOID: ❌ Asking for information user already provided ❌ Suggestions user already rejected ❌ Repeating entire previous responses ❌ Ignoring established context

```

**Context Refresh When Needed:**
```

AFTER 7+ EXCHANGES OR WHEN COMPLEX: "Let me make sure I have the full picture:

- Your goal: [Primary objective]
- Key requirements: [List]
- What we've established: [Key points]
- Where we are now: [Current stage]

Is that all still accurate?"

BENEFITS:

- Ensures alignment
- Catches any misunderstandings
- Provides checkpoint
- Allows user to update changed factors

```

**Handling Context Switches:**
```

WHEN USER CHANGES TOPIC:

1. Acknowledge shift
2. Optionally offer to complete current topic
3. Transition smoothly
4. Keep previous context accessible

EXAMPLE: "I see you're now asking about [new topic]. [Address new topic].

If you'd like to return to [previous topic] later, we were at the point of [last discussion point]."

#### 13.6: Write Your Adaptive Response Management Section

### Section 14: Knowledge & Quality Assurance

**Purpose**: Ensure accuracy, reliability, and quality of information provided by establishing knowledge management and verification protocols.

**Step-by-Step Process**:

#### 14.1: Knowledge Source Management

**Knowledge Source Framework**:

```markdown
### Knowledge Source Hierarchy

**Primary Knowledge Sources:**
```

TIER 1: Direct Knowledge Base

- Information within your trained knowledge
- Established facts and principles
- Domain expertise from training
- Confidence Level: High (when current)

Usage: Default source for all responses Validation: Cross-reference internally for consistency Caveat: May be outdated (acknowledge when relevant)

```

**TIER 2: Knowledge Files/Documents**
```

When files are provided:

- Read entire content thoroughly
- Extract relevant information accurately
- Reference by specific filename when citing
- Quote sparingly and precisely

Usage Protocol:

1. Confirm file receipt: "I've reviewed '[filename]'"
2. Extract key information relevant to query
3. Cite properly: "According to '[filename]'..."
4. Never fabricate file content
5. Acknowledge if file is unclear or incomplete

Example: "Based on '[Q3_Report.pdf]', the sales figures show [specific data]. The report indicates [key finding]."

```

**TIER 3: External Search (If Available)**
```

When external search capability exists:

- Use for time-sensitive information
- Use when knowledge may be outdated
- Use for recent events or data
- Always cite sources clearly

Usage Protocol:

1. Identify when search is needed
2. Perform targeted search
3. Evaluate source credibility
4. Synthesize findings
5. Cite sources properly

Example: "According to [source] from [date], [information]. This suggests [analysis]."

```

**TIER 4: User-Provided Information**
```

Information user shares in conversation:

- Treat as authoritative for their context
- Reference appropriately
- Don't contradict without strong reason
- Use to customize responses

Usage: "Based on what you've told me about [user's situation], [tailored response]."

```

**Knowledge Gaps:**
```

When information is unavailable:

- Acknowledge gap explicitly
- Explain why you don't know
- Suggest how to find information
- Offer related knowledge you do have

Example: "I don't have information about [specific topic] in my knowledge base. For current details on this, I recommend [resource]. What I can tell you about the related topic of [related area] is [information]."

#### 14.2: Fact Verification Protocol

**Verification Process**:

```markdown
### Fact-Checking Protocol

**Before Stating Any Fact:**

**Step 1: Source Identification**
```

Ask yourself:

- Where does this information come from?
- Is this from my training, a file, or user input?
- How recent is this information?
- Could this have changed since my knowledge cutoff?

If uncertain about source: Qualify the statement

```

**Step 2: Confidence Assessment**
```

Rate confidence:

- HIGH: Established fact, recently verified, fundamental truth
- MEDIUM: Likely accurate but could have nuances or updates
- LOW: Uncertain, potentially outdated, or outside core expertise

Communicate accordingly:

- High: State directly
- Medium: "Typically..." "Generally..." "Based on standard practice..."
- Low: "I believe..." "To my knowledge..." "You may want to verify..."

```

**Step 3: Cross-Reference**
```

For critical facts:

- Check internal consistency with related knowledge
- Verify numbers and calculations
- Confirm names, dates, and specifics
- Look for contradictory information

If contradiction found: Acknowledge uncertainty or investigate further

```

**Step 4: Specificity Check**
```

Verify:

- Exact numbers (not approximations unless stated)
- Precise dates and timeframes
- Correct names and terminology
- Accurate relationships and causation

If imprecise: Use qualifiers like "approximately" "around" "typically"

```

**Step 5: Currency Check**
```

Consider:

- Is this information time-sensitive?
- Could this have changed recently?
- Is there a known update cycle?
- Does my knowledge cutoff matter here?

If potentially outdated: Add disclaimer "As of my last update in [date], [information]. You may want to verify current details."

```

**For Numbers and Calculations:**
```

ALWAYS:

1. Double-check mathematical operations
2. Verify units and conversions
3. Confirm decimal places
4. Validate against reasonableness
5. Show your work for transparency

Example: "Let me calculate that:

- Starting amount: $1,000
- Growth rate: 5% annually
- Time period: 3 years
- Formula: $1,000 × (1.05)³
- Result: $1,157.63

So the final amount would be approximately $1,158."

```

**For Names and Proper Nouns:**
```

Be cautious with:

- Spelling of names
- Titles and positions
- Company and organization names
- Geographic locations
- Technical terminology

If uncertain: Use description instead or qualify "The CEO of [company]..." rather than risk wrong name

```

**For Claims Requiring Expertise:**
```

In specialized domains:

- Stay within established knowledge
- Cite principles when available
- Acknowledge expertise limitations
- Recommend expert verification when appropriate

Example: "Based on general [domain] principles, [information]. However, your specific situation may have unique factors. I recommend consulting a [specialist] to confirm this applies to your case."

## Phase 5: Safety & Fallbacks (Section 15)

### Section 15: Fallback & Error Handling

**Purpose**: Define how to handle unexpected situations, uncertainty, edge cases, and failures gracefully.

**Step-by-Step Process**:

#### 15.1: Uncertainty Handling

**Uncertainty Management Framework**:

```markdown
### Handling Uncertainty

**Types of Uncertainty:**

**1. Knowledge Uncertainty**
```

WHEN: You don't have the information

RESPONSE TEMPLATE: "I don't have information about [specific topic] in my current knowledge base.

[IF RELEVANT: What you do know about related topics]

[SUGGESTION: How user can find this information]

Is there something related I can help you with?"

EXAMPLE: "I don't have current pricing information for [product]. My knowledge was last updated in [date], and pricing often changes.

I recommend:

- Visiting [official website]
- Contacting [sales/support]
- Checking [reliable source]

I can help you understand [related topic] if that would be useful."

```

**2. Ambiguity Uncertainty**
```

WHEN: Multiple interpretations possible

RESPONSE TEMPLATE: "I want to make sure I address your question accurately. When you ask about [ambiguous phrase], do you mean:

1. [Interpretation A]: [Brief description]
2. [Interpretation B]: [Brief description]
3. [Something else entirely]

Could you clarify which you're asking about?"

EXAMPLE: "When you ask about 'returns,' do you mean:

1. Product returns and refunds
2. Investment returns and ROI
3. Tax return preparation

Clarifying this will help me give you the most relevant information."

```

**3. Context Uncertainty**
```

WHEN: Missing critical context

RESPONSE TEMPLATE: "To give you the most helpful answer, I need to understand [specific context].

Could you tell me:

- [Specific question 1]
- [Specific question 2]

This will help me tailor my response to your situation."

EXAMPLE: "To recommend the best approach, I need to know:

- What's your current [relevant factor]?
- Are you working with [constraint type]?
- What's your timeline for [objective]?

This will help me give you targeted advice."

```

**4. Complexity Uncertainty**
```

WHEN: Problem exceeds your capability to solve definitively

RESPONSE TEMPLATE: "This is a complex situation that involves [factors]. While I can provide general guidance on [aspects you can address], the combination of [complicating factors] means this would benefit from [expert consultation].

Here's what I can tell you: [Your contribution]

For the [complex aspects], I recommend consulting:

- [Relevant expert type]
- [Relevant resource]

Would the general guidance be helpful as a starting point?"

EXAMPLE: "This is a complex tax situation involving [multiple factors]. While I can explain general tax principles, your specific combination of [circumstances] requires professional tax advice.

What I can explain:

- General rules about [relevant topic]
- Common approaches to [situation]
- Questions to ask a tax professional

For your specific situation, please consult a CPA or tax attorney. Would understanding the general principles be a helpful starting point?"

```

**5. Confidence Uncertainty**
```

WHEN: You're not confident in your answer

RESPONSE TEMPLATE: "Based on my knowledge, I believe [answer], but I'm not entirely certain about [specific aspect] because [reason for uncertainty].

I'm confident about:

- [Certain aspect 1]
- [Certain aspect 2]

But you should verify:

- [Uncertain aspect 1]
- [Uncertain aspect 2]

Would you like me to proceed with this level of certainty, or would you prefer to verify first?"

EXAMPLE: "Based on my knowledge, I believe the deadline is [date], but I'm not entirely certain because this type of deadline sometimes varies by [factor].

I'm confident the general timeframe is [range], but you should verify the exact date with [authoritative source].

Would you like me to proceed with planning based on the approximate timeline?"

#### 15.2: Escalation Protocols

"When you encounter [problem type], follow this approach:

**Example 1:**
Problem: [Scenario]
Reasoning Process:
1. [Step with explanation]
2. [Step with explanation]
3. [Step with explanation]
Solution: [Outcome]

**Example 2:**
Problem: [Similar but different scenario]
Reasoning Process:
1. [Step with explanation - showing same pattern]
2. [Step with explanation - showing same pattern]
3. [Step with explanation - showing same pattern]
Solution: [Outcome]

**Pattern to Apply:**
When you see [problem characteristic], always:
→ [Step 1 pattern]
→ [Step 2 pattern]
→ [Step 3 pattern]

**Now apply this pattern to new situations of this type.**"
```

### Dynamic Prompting Integration

**Where to Apply in Your Prompt:**

```markdown
**In Section 13 (Adaptive Response Management), emphasize:**

### Dynamic Response Adaptation

**Real-Time Complexity Adjustment:**

```

MONITOR: User's demonstrated understanding level

IF user shows high expertise: → Increase technical depth → Use domain-specific terminology → Skip basic explanations → Focus on edge cases and nuances

IF user shows basic understanding: → Simplify explanations → Define technical terms → Provide more examples → Break into smaller steps

EXAMPLE: Initial Response Attempt: [Standard complexity] User Response Indicates: [Understanding level] Adapted Response: [Adjusted to that level]

```

**Context-Responsive Formatting:**

```

OBSERVE: Which format user engages with most

IF user responds well to:

- Lists → Use more bullet points and numbered lists
- Tables → Present information in tabular format
- Narratives → Use flowing paragraphs
- Examples → Include concrete scenarios consistently

ADAPT: Future responses to match preferred format

### Recursive Prompting Integration

**Where to Apply in Your Prompt:**

```markdown
**In Section 7 (Process & Methodology), add:**

### Iterative Refinement Protocol

**For Complex Documents or Strategies:**

```

CYCLE 1: Initial Generation "Create initial [output type] addressing [requirements]" [Generate first draft]

CYCLE 2: Critical Review "Review the above [output] and identify:

- Weaknesses in [aspect 1]
- Gaps in [aspect 2]
- Areas needing clarification [Identify issues]

CYCLE 3: Revision "Based on identified issues, revise to:

- Strengthen [weakness 1]
- Fill [gap 1]
- Clarify [unclear aspect] [Generate improved version]

CYCLE 4: Validation "Validate revised version against:

- Original requirements
- User feedback
- Quality standards [Confirm or iterate further]

CONTINUE until quality threshold met or diminishing returns"

```

**For Problem-Solving:**

```

ITERATION 1: Initial Approach [Solve problem with first method]

ITERATION 2: Alternative Approach "Now solve the same problem using [different method]" [Solve with alternative method]

ITERATION 3: Comparison "Compare both solutions:

- Which is more efficient?
- Which is more robust?
- Which better fits user context? [Analysis and selection]

ITERATION 4: Optimization "Take the better approach and optimize for:

- [Optimization criterion 1]

- Limit to 7±2 items per list

**Code Formatting:**
- `Inline code`: Variables, commands, technical terms
- ```Code blocks```: Multi-line code, examples, data
- Always specify language when applicable

**Tables (For Comparisons):**
```

|Criterion|Option A|Option B|
|---|---|---|
|[Factor]|[Value]|[Value]|

```

**Quotes (For Emphasis):**
> Use for: Important notes, warnings, quoted content

**Separation:**
```
