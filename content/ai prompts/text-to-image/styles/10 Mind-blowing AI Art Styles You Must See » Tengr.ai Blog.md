## 10 Mind-blowing AI Art Styles You Must See

Our previous explorations into special AI art styles have been quite popular. Now, we’re back to share with you some more fascinating styles. If you’ve missed our previous posts, don’t worry. Our posts on **[Special AI Art Styles](https://blog.tengrai.com/docs/special-ai-art-styles/)** and **[Magic Words to Enhance AI Images](https://blog.tengrai.com/docs/magic-words-to-enhance-ai-images/)** are waiting for you to discover them.

This time, we’ve brought even more impressive styles for you. So, whether you’re more into the old-school charm of Risograph or Sumi-e art, or the edgy Glitch Art or ASCII Art, there’s something here for everyone’s taste.

We all want images that stand out. Using these styles in your prompts is a good way to do that. The best thing is that they can add that ‘special something’ to even the simplest, most basic prompts. Even if you’re already familiar with some of them, we’ll provide plenty of examples to give you an extra dose of inspiration. So let’s get started!

### 1\. Glitch Art

You know those digital or analog errors in corrupted files, called **glitches**? Now, we can transform them into visually striking images. To be honest, this effect is amazing and chaotic, but truly artistic.

As you’ll see, Tengr.ai does a great job with applying these **glitch effects, pixelations, and scan lines** to images. So, if you’re looking for an edgy, out-of-the-ordinary, modern look for your AI-generated images, play around with this style. It’s really ‘chaotic’ in a good way.

**Tip:** Based on our experience, it pairs really well with the double exposure technique. It gives images a very artistic, unique look with ‘lovable imperfections’.

“ *Double exposure, the eye of a warrior superimposed against a war scene, abstract surrealism, (heavy use of glitch effects), very dynamic, sepia and brownish dark tones.*“

![Glitch art image of an eye](https://blog.tengrai.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Glitch-Art-2.webp)

“ *(Glitch art landscape), Double exposure, stunningly beautiful, distorted and glitchy, abstract, fragmented digital noise, vibrant color distortions, strong glitch effects, very dynamic, intricate details.*“

### 2\. Art Deco Revival

**Art Deco** was a popular aesthetic trend in the early 20 <sup>th</sup> century. Now, in recent years, it’s gaining popularity again. It is mostly known for its **bold geometric shapes**, **rich colors**, **luxurious materials**, and **timeless elegance**. We mostly see this style in architecture and [interior design](https://blog.tengrai.com/docs/ai-interior-design-styles/).

![Art Deco Revival image of a building](https://blog.tengrai.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Art-Deco-revival-5.webp)

In AI art, **Art Deco Revival** merges these well-known classic luxurious elements with contemporary or futuristic subjects.

“ *Art Deco Revival building, intricately designed, exquisite architecture, neon outlines, starry night sky background, awe-striking architectural design, sleek lines.*“

![Art Deco Revival image of a skyscraper](https://blog.tengrai.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Art-Deco-revival-2.webp)

### 3\. Pop Surrealism

**Pop Surrealism** (or ‘Lowbrow art’) brings the best of both the Surrealist and the Pop culture worlds. It features whimsical or sometimes even grotesque elements, managing to create a **surreal atmosphere**, with a touch of humor or irony.

We love how Tengr.ai interprets this style, creating **surreal, dreamlike scenes** with **bright, exaggerated colors**, and **exaggerated proportions**. Using this style, you’ll get truly eye-catching images with a special twist.

“ *Pop surrealism portrait, vibrant colors, exaggerated features.*“

![Pop Surrealism image of two girls](https://blog.tengrai.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Pop-Surrealism-2.webp)

“ *Pop surrealism portrait, Exaggerated facial features, dream-like, otherworldly atmosphere,

“ *A robot having a tea party with stuffed animals, in the style of Pop surrealism*.”

And here are a few more portraits made in this style:

### 4\. Risograph

This style reminds us of the **typical old-school look of ‘digital screen printing’**. It has that unique **grainy texture** and **misaligned colors** that cannot be confused with other printing methods.

What will happen if we add this style to our prompts in Tengr.ai? Well, for starters it will give that **vintage grainy look and color palette** that Risograph prints usually have. And, the best thing is that Tengr.ai can apply this effect to contemporary subjects as well, giving them a **cool retro look**.

“ *Vintage travel poster for a retro space tourism company, with bold, slightly misaligned colors, in Risograph style, risograph grain effect.*“

![Vintage travel poster](https://blog.tengrai.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Risograph-11.webp)

### 5\. Abstract Data Art

The essence of this style is **turning data patterns and information into futuristic images**. Basically, it turns these complex data and information into stunning abstract, visually captivating art. It adds a special and **futuristic effect** to images.

“ *Abstract data landscape, digital mountains made of spreadsheets and code streams.*“

![Abstract Data Art landscape](https://blog.tengrai.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Abstract-Data-Art-12.webp)

### 6\. Kinetic Art

Traditional **Kinetic Art** involves movement. AI-generated Kinetic Art creates the **illusion of motion** in images, or it just gives a cool and dynamic visual effect with repetitive patterns or optical illusions. Either way, it’s worth trying out if you’re looking for an **energetic, dynamic visual**.

“ *A flock of origami birds seemingly in flight, suspended in a spiral formation against a vibrant sunset* “

![A flock of origami birds](https://blog.tengrai.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Origami.webp)

“ *Kinetic art, the illusion of movement, ethereal, surreal, vast utopian landscape, contemplative human figure, dynamic and energetic visuals, nightcore.*“

### 7\. ASCII Art Overlay

[ASCII art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art), also known as ’text art’ or ‘word art’ is a graphic design technique that is a little bit more difficult to understand in the context of art. It uses letters, numbers, and characters from the ASCII chart to form pictures.

When we add this style to our prompts, Tengr.ai creates a **cool textured overlay**. It gives a very unique and **complex look** to AI images, kind of like blending traditional with futuristic elements.

“ *Utopian world, contemplative wanderer, buildings, (ASCII art overlay), kinetic art, nightcore, biopunk, optic art*.”

![Utopian world image with ASCII art overlay](https://blog.tengrai.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ascii-Art-1-f.webp)

### 8\. Synesthesia Art

Now this one is a truly fascinating and captivating style. Once you start playing around with it, you just can’t stop. Let’s see where it comes from. The word ‘Synesthesia’ can be explained as **experiencing the world in a special way at a sensory level**. [Synesthesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synesthesia_in_art) is like a superpower in making art. It’s about **mixing different senses together to make unique artwork**. For instance, people with synesthesia may experience specific colors when they hear music or taste distinct flavors when they say certain words.

![Synesthesia art soundwaves](https://blog.tengrai.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Synesthesia-11.webp)

Synesthesia art soundwaves

AI can create images that represent how music might look to someone with synesthesia, or visualize the ‘color’ of different words or emotions. Or, it could just be a special and fun effect to add to images. Either way, we love the whimsical effect it gave to our images.

“ *(Synesthesia art), Taste of Nostalgia: Childhood memories as flavor-coded orbs, bittersweet hues swirling, texture of old photographs.*“

### 9\. Sumi-e Art

A traditional **East Asian fluid ink wash painting technique** that is very beautifully replicated by Tengr.ai. With its minimalist aesthetic, it gives images a **calm, tranquil atmosphere**. If you like this type of art, give it a try and see what Tengr.ai can make of it. We think it’s totally breathtaking.

**Tip:** Based on our experimentations, **[Default](https://blog.tengrai.com/docs/styles/)** and **Illustration** styles captured that serene ink wash appearance the best, in **Seer mode**.

“ *(Sumi-e style), Japanese ink art, red accents, dynamic flowing elements, energetic, blend of futuristic and traditional Japanese elements*.”

![Sumi-e art image with red accents](https://i0.wp.com/blog.tengrai.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Sumi-e-13-1024x585.webp?strip=info&w=600&ssl=1)

### 10\. Low Poly 3D

This style has a distinct **angular aesthetic**. **Complex forms are simplified into polygonal shapes**. In AI art, photorealistic subjects can be turned into their low poly equivalents. We can create entire 3D scenes using simple polygonal shapes. It’s a fun style.

“ *Low poly 3D art of a prehistoric angular dinosaur roaming around a 3D cityscape, with towering skyscrapers constructed from vibrant geometric shapes, (Low poly 3D render).*“

![Low Poly 3D dinosaur in a cityscape](https://blog.tengrai.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Low-Poly-3D-3.webp)

**Extra Tip:** It could be a cool experiment to try combining some of these styles. For example, combining Kinetic art with ASCII art resulted in some unexpectedly good images with a unique effect. **What other style combinations do you think would work well?**
