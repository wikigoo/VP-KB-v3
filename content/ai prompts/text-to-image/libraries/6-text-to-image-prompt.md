#### Minimalist line-art portraits

# Minimalist line-art portraits Style

**Core Style Description**  
Produce portraits in a **minimalist black-and-white line-art style**, emphasizing men’s hairstyles and facial hair. Use **bold, precise linework** with high contrast. Do not use color or shading; depth comes only from line thickness and placement. The overall aesthetic should feel **clean, timeless, and barbershop-inspired**, combining classic masculine styling with a graphic, modern edge.

**Key Rules**

- **Linework:** Heavy, confident black lines. No gradients, no shading — only varying line thickness.
    
- **Hair & Beards:** Stylized with exaggerated shape, volume, and flow. Echoes barbershop branding, hipster aesthetics, or vintage tattoo flash.
    
- **Facial Structure:** Simplified anatomy. Strikes a balance between realism and cartoon — sharp, deliberate strokes, not overly detailed.
    
- **Framing:** Portraits should be contained in simple square or rectangular frames, suitable for posters, icons, or branding sheets.
    
- **Mood:** Timeless, confident, slightly graphic-novel or engraving-inspired.
    

**Descriptors to Include in Prompts**

- “Minimalist line-art portraits”
    
- “Black-and-white vector illustration”
    
- “Barbershop / grooming reference style”
    
- “Modern masculine portrait sketch”
    
- “Vintage tattoo flash aesthetic”
    
- “Hipster ink illustration”
    
- “Clean monochrome character drawing”
    

**Example Prompt Structure**

> _“Black-and-white minimalist line-art portrait of a man with a styled haircut and full beard, bold clean lines, high contrast, no shading, barbershop illustration style, vintage tattoo flash influence, vector look, contained in a square frame.”_
