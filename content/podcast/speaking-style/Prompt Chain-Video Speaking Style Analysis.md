Raw video above transcript that needs cleaning for analysis. Please clean it while preserving the speaker's authentic voice:

CLEANING INSTRUCTIONS:
- Fix obvious transcription errors (misheard words that don't make sense)
- Add basic punctuation (periods, commas) for readability
- Remove excessive filler words (um, uh) EXCEPT when they seem intentional or create characteristic rhythm
- Preserve repetitions used for emphasis ("really, really important")
- Keep incomplete sentences that reflect natural speech patterns
- Add paragraph breaks at natural topic shifts or significant pauses
- Do NOT make the language more formal
- Do NOT fix grammatical "errors" that reflect natural speech
- Do NOT remove the speaker's personality quirks

After cleaning, create a separate section titled "INITIAL OBSERVATIONS" where you note:
- Frequently repeated phrases you noticed
- Distinctive speech patterns
- How the speaker transitions between topics
- Any obvious signature elements
