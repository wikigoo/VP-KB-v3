Step-by-step guide for non-technical users to build a prompt-chain workflow using a no-code tool like Daisy Chain AI
## What You Need Before You Begin

- Access to a no-code prompt-chaining tool (e.g. **Daisy Chain AI**) which lets you define workflows of prompts. ([Daisy Chain AI](https://daisychainai.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Daisy Chain - No Code AI Workflow Editor"))
    
- A stable ChatGPT or LLM account (or the tool’s built-in model).
    
- The sequence of prompt steps you want (for journalism: research → outline → draft → review → final, etc.).
    
- A topic or working idea (e.g. “Israeli actions in Gaza war”) to test the chain.

## Step-by-Step Setup in Daisy Chain AI (or Equivalent)

I’ll use Daisy Chain AI as the example, but other tools (Typeblock, PromptChainer) follow a similar logic.

### Step 1: Sign Up & Log In

- Go to **daisychainai.com** and register (free plan or beta). ([Daisy Chain AI](https://daisychainai.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Daisy Chain - No Code AI Workflow Editor"))
    
- Log in and access the dashboard where you manage “workflows.”
    

### Step 2: Create a New Workflow

- Click “New Workflow” (or similar).
    
- Name it something descriptive, e.g. **“Analytical Journalism Chain – Gaza Conflict.”**
    
- Optionally set a description so you remember its purpose.
    

### Step 3: Add Prompt Nodes (Steps)

You’ll build a chain of prompt nodes. Each node is one prompt that does a part of the task.

For your journalism chain, add nodes in this order:

1. **Angle / Thesis Node**
    
    - Prompt: “Suggest 3 analytical angles for writing about _[topic]_, with pros/cons.”
        
2. **Source Gathering Node**
    
    - Prompt: “For the selected angle, list 10 credible recent sources (news, UN, NGOs) with short summaries and reliability notes.”
        
3. **Fact Matrix Node**
    
    - Prompt: “From those sources, build a fact matrix: key claims, figures, caveats, and counterclaims.”
        
4. **Outline Node**
    
    - Prompt: “Using the fact matrix, propose a detailed outline (title, introduction, 4-6 main sections, conclusion).”
        
5. **Draft Article Node**
    
    - Prompt: “Write a ~1,500-word analytical journalism draft per the outline, with attribution and balance.”
        
6. **Headline Ideas Node**
    
    - Prompt: “Suggest 5 creative yet accurate headlines/subtitles for the draft.”
        
7. **Editorial Review Node**
    
    - Prompt: “Act as an editor: critique tone, structure, balance, redundancies, weak parts.”
        
8. **Fact-Check Node**
    
    - Prompt: “Cross-check factual claims in the draft against the fact matrix; flag mismatches or unsupported claims.”
        
9. **Final Rewrite Node**
    
    - Prompt: “Rewrite the article in polished Markdown, British spelling, incorporate edits and references.”
        
10. **Telegram Teaser Node**
    
    - Prompt: “Generate a Telegram-style headline and 2–3 sentence teaser description for the article.”
        

### Step 4: Connect the Nodes (Chain Them)

- Use Daisy Chain’s editor interface to link each node in sequence: Node 1 → Node 2 → Node 3 → … → Node 10.
    
- Set each node’s **input** to come from the **output** of the previous node.
    
- The tool ensures the text output from one prompt becomes input to the next prompt.
    

### Step 5: Configure Prompt Settings

- For each node, you can set parameters like **model version** (e.g. GPT-4 vs GPT-3.5), **temperature**, **max tokens**.
    
- You may also include template variables (e.g. “{{Angle}}” or “{{Outline}}”) which Daisy Chain replaces dynamically.
    
- If the tool allows optional fallback or branching logic, you can set a node to rerun or branch if output is unsatisfactory.
    

### Step 6: Run the Workflow

- Click “Run Workflow” (or similar). The chain will execute: first prompt runs, then its output is fed into node 2, then node 3, and so on.
    
- The system shows you each node’s output in sequence, so you can inspect and intervene if needed.
    

### Step 7: Review Intermediate Outputs

- After each node finishes, check its result:
    
    - Did the angle suggestions make sense?
        
    - Is the source list credible?
        
    - Is the fact matrix correct and complete?
        
    - Is the outline logical?
        
- If a node’s output is weak, you can **edit that node’s prompt** and re-run from that point onward (without restarting the whole chain).
    

### Step 8: Receive Final Article + Teaser

- After node 10 completes, you’ll get your **polished, final article** (in Markdown) plus a **Telegram headline and teaser**.
    
- You can copy, export, or publish as needed.
    

### Step 9: Save, Duplicate, Share Workflow

- Save the workflow so you can reuse it or adapt for other topics.
    
- Some tools let you **share the workflow template** (without exposing your prompts) to collaborators. In Daisy Chain, you can share a workflow privately or publicly. ([Daisy Chain AI](https://daisychainai.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Daisy Chain - No Code AI Workflow Editor"))
    
- You can duplicate and tweak for different subjects.

## Tips & Best Practices

- **One focused task per prompt**: don’t overload a node with multiple jobs.
    
- **Restate context**: each prompt should carry needed context (e.g. the chosen angle, or fact matrix) because the model might not “remember” everything otherwise.
    
- **Limit output length**: set max tokens so each node response stays manageable.
    
- **Validate before proceeding**: don’t run the full chain blindly—inspect key nodes first.
    
- **Iterate & refine**: over time you’ll adjust prompt wording in nodes to make the chain more robust.
    
- **Use placeholders**: use tokens like `{{Outline}}` or `{{Angle}}` to let the tool auto-insert earlier outputs.
    
- **Backup versions**: keep versions of your workflow so you don’t lose prior chaining logic.

## Visual Example (Simplified)

Here’s a mock layout of how the chain looks:

```
[ Node 1: Angle ] —> [ Node 2: Sources ] —> [ Node 3: Fact Matrix ] —>  
     —> [ Node 4: Outline ] —> [ Node 5: Draft ] —> [ Node 6: Headlines ]
     —> [ Node 7: Review ] —> [ Node 8: Fact-Check ] —> [ Node 9: Final Rewrite ]
     —> [ Node 10: Telegram Teaser ]
```

Each arrow passes output as input. You click “play” to run, inspect, tweak, rerun parts, and get final output.
