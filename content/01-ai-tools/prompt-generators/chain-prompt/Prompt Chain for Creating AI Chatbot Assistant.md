## PROMPT 1: Discovery & Planning

```
I want to create a personal AI chatbot assistant using the guide I've uploaded.

Please analyze the guide and ask me these questions:

1. What is the main purpose of my chatbot? (What should it help me with?)
2. What tone should it use? (Formal professional / Friendly conversational / Technical expert / Other)
3. Who is the target user? (Just me / My team / General audience)
4. What topics should it cover? (List main areas)
5. What topics should it NOT cover? (What's out of scope?)
6. Do I have any knowledge base documents attached? If yes, briefly summarize what's in them.

After I answer, create a brief project plan showing:
- Chatbot role and purpose (2-3 sentences)
- Tone and style
- Scope (in/out)
- List of 4 documents you'll create for me

Wait for my answers before proceeding.
