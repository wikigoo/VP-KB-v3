# How to Write Creative Content Prompts

## Purpose
This guide shows you how to write the main prompt for creative content chatbots. Main prompts should be SHORT (500-700 words) because complexity goes in knowledge base files, not in prompts.

---

## Step 1: Identify Content Type & Audience
**What to extract from user:**
- Content type (podcast script, video script, article, social post, etc.)
- Target audience (who will consume this content?)
- Tone requirements (professional, humorous, casual, formal)
- Special needs (specific structure, timing, visual elements)

**Example extraction:**
User says: "I need something for TikTok scripts about productivity, funny tone"
→ Content type: Video script (short-form)
→ Audience: Gen Z, productivity enthusiasts
→ Tone: Humorous, sarcastic
→ Special: Visual cues needed, 30-60 seconds

---

## Step 2: Determine If Style Sample Is Needed

**ALWAYS include style sample for:**
- Humor-dependent content (comedy, sarcasm, wit)
- Brand voice consistency (specific company tone)
- Niche audience language (Gen Z, professional, academic)
- Performance content (speeches, presentations)

**Style sample optional for:**
- Straightforward informational content
- Standard article/blog formats
- Generic professional tone

**Ask user if unclear:**
"For [content type] with [tone], I recommend including a style sample file. This ensures consistent voice. Should I include it?"

---

## Step 3: Write the Main Prompt

**Use this exact structure from `[prompt_template.md]`:**

### Section 1: Title & Role
- Title: `# <Content Type> Creator`
- Role: One sentence describing expertise
- Keep it simple and clear

**Example:**
```markdown
# Podcast Script Generator

## Role
Expert podcast scriptwriter for tech startup content
```

### Section 2: Objective
- One sentence: what this chatbot generates
- Must mention "following knowledge base files exactly"

**Example:**
```markdown
## Objective
Generate 20-30 minute podcast episode scripts by following knowledge base files exactly
```

### Section 3: Mandatory Process
- **Critical:** ALWAYS start with "ALWAYS read knowledge base files in this exact order:"
- List all 3 files (or 2 if no style sample)
- Include 5-6 process steps total
- Keep each step to one line

**Example:**
```markdown
## Mandatory Process
1. **ALWAYS read knowledge base files in this exact order:**
   - `[step_by_step_guide.md]` → Follow each step sequentially
   - `[output_template.md]` → Use this exact structure
   - `[style_sample.md]` → Match this tone/style
2. Extract user requirements (topic, length, specific requests)
3. Execute step-by-step guide without deviation
4. Apply output template structure exactly
5. Match style sample tone
6. Verify output matches template before delivery
```

### Section 4: Rules
- 3-5 rules maximum
- **First rule MUST be:** "Never skip reading knowledge base files"
- **Second rule MUST be:** "Never generate from memory—only from files"
- Add content-specific rules (visual cues, timing, structure requirements)

**Example:**
```markdown
## Rules
- **Never skip reading knowledge base files**
- **Never generate from memory—only from files**
- **Never deviate from step-by-step guide**
- **Always include [MUSIC CUE] and timestamp markers**
- **Match conversational tone from style sample**
```

### Section 5: Output
- One sentence describing output format
- Reference the template file

**Example:**
```markdown
## Output
Follow structure in `[output_template.md]` exactly with all timestamps
```

---

## Step 4: Verify Prompt Quality

**Checklist before delivery:**
- [ ] Word count: 500-700 words
- [ ] All knowledge base files referenced by name
- [ ] "ALWAYS read files first" instruction present
- [ ] Rules include "never skip files" and "never use memory"
- [ ] Plain language (no jargon)
- [ ] Content-specific requirements included (timestamps, visual cues, etc.)

---

## Step 5: Common Mistakes to Avoid

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Write long prompts (>700 words)
- ❌ Include process logic in prompt (that goes in step-by-step guide)
- ❌ Forget to reference knowledge base files by exact name
- ❌ Use technical jargon
- ❌ Skip the "read files first" instruction
- ❌ Make rules vague ("follow best practices" is useless)

**DO:**
- ✅ Keep it simple and short
- ✅ Reference files explicitly
- ✅ Use clear, specific rules
- ✅ Include content-specific requirements
- ✅ Make file-reading mandatory

## Template Variables to Customize

When writing prompts, customize these elements:

| Variable | What to Change | Example |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| `<Content Type>` | Type of content generated | "Podcast Script", "Video Script", "Article" |
| `<Audience>` | Target audience | "tech enthusiasts", "Gen Z", "business professionals" |
| `<Length>` | Target length | "30 seconds", "20 minutes", "800 words" |
| `<Tone>` | Voice/style | "conversational", "humorous", "professional" |
| `<Special Requirements>` | Content-specific needs | "timestamps", "visual cues", "citations" |
| `<File Names>` | Knowledge base files | Always use bracket format: `[filename.md]` |

---

## Final Notes

**Remember:**
- Main prompt = Traffic cop (directs to files)
- Knowledge base files = Actual instructions
- Keep prompts SHORT—complexity lives in files
- File-first reading is NON-NEGOTIABLE
- Always use exact file names in brackets: `[filename.md]`
