Title: "Mic Check for the End of the World"

Setting: A dimly lit basement comedy club in a mid-sized city. Fairy lights string across the low ceiling. The crowd is a mix—students, young professionals, artists, and a couple of older faces nursing craft beers and quiet skepticism. A neon sign behind the stage flickers: “Open Mic Mondays – Speak Your Truth.”

Characters:

Elliot Vega – A thirty-something comedian known for his biting sarcasm and political wit. Wears a thrifted blazer, faded jeans, and sneakers that squeak.
The MC – A perpetually optimistic host trying to keep spirits high.
Audience Members – Off-screen voices and reactions.

(The MC steps on stage, grinning nervously into the mic.)

MC: All right, give it up for our next act! You’ve probably seen him yelling into a camera on social media, but tonight he’s yelling at you! Make some noise for Elliot Vega!

(Scattered cheers and claps. Elliot shuffles up, adjusts the mic stand, squints into the dim crowd.)

Elliot: Wow. Look at this turnout. Nothing says “society’s doing great” like fifty adults drinking on a Monday night in a basement that smells faintly of regret and IPA.

(Laughter ripples.)

Elliot: No, really. I appreciate you all choosing this existential therapy session over going home and doom-scrolling the latest extinction countdown. You’re my kind of people.

(He leans forward conspiratorially.)
So, climate change, huh? We can’t fix the planet, but we can definitely invent ten new streaming services this year. Priorities. We’re basically rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic... except now the deck chairs come with personalized ads and a monthly subscription fee.

(Audience laughs. Someone whistles approval.)

Elliot: You laugh, but I saw a commercial last week for eco-friendly bottled water. It’s like regular water, but it costs twice as much and comes in packaging that says, “We care.” That’s capitalism’s favorite pickup line—we care.

(He mimes a corporate exec voice.)
“Sure, we’re melting the glaciers, but have you tried our new carbon-neutral latte art?”

(He takes a sip of his drink, pacing slightly.)

Elliot: Speaking of caring, let’s talk about government accountability—
(pauses, shrugs)
Yeah, that’s the joke.

(Audience bursts into chuckles.)

Elliot: No, seriously. Every election we’re told, “Your vote matters!” Meanwhile, billionaires are out here treating democracy like a hobby. I’m just waiting for the next debate to be sponsored by a crypto exchange. “Tonight’s policy discussion is brought to you by people who tanked your savings but promise to build a better metaverse.”

(Applause and groans alike.)

Elliot: I get it, though. It’s hard to fight the system when the system has better lawyers and a TikTok account.

(He sighs dramatically.)
Remember when movements used to have marches and manifestos? Now they’ve got hashtags and brand partnerships. The revolution will be livestreamed—but only for subscribers.

(He scans the audience, spots someone recording on their phone.)

Elliot: Oh, you’re filming? Perfect. Just make sure you tag me when this inevitably gets taken out of context and I’m trending as “Elliot the Anticapitalist Hypocrite.” I’ll need the exposure. And maybe a sponsorship deal with oat milk.

(The audience laughs harder now, warming to his rhythm.)

Elliot: You know what’s wild? We keep being told to “reduce, reuse, recycle,” but never “maybe regulate the companies dumping sludge into rivers.” It’s always our fault.
Like, “Oh, the sea turtles are dying because you used a plastic straw.”
Yeah, Karen, I killed the turtles—me and my frappuccino. Shell Oil had nothing to do with it.

(A woman from the back: “Preach!”)

Elliot: Thank you, sister in rage. I’ll see you at the support group for people who can’t afford organic avocados anymore.

(He paces, then softens his tone.)

Elliot: But you know, the hardest part about doing political comedy is that the news keeps outpacing your punchlines. I write a joke on Tuesday, and by Thursday the government’s already turned it into a documentary.

Last week, I had this whole bit about corruption scandals—then a senator literally got caught taking bribes in Bitcoin. I mean, my guy couldn’t even commit crimes in analog. It’s like watching history collapse in 4K.

(He shakes his head.)
And yet, nothing surprises us anymore. If an alien spaceship landed tomorrow and demanded our leader, half the population would argue about which influencer counts as “world representative.”

(Audience laughs, some clapping.)

(Elliot grabs the mic stand, twirls it absentmindedly.)

Elliot: But let’s be honest—it’s not all doom and gloom. We’ve still got… memes. And, uh… podcasts. And a collective existential dread that keeps us bonded through irony. That’s progress, right?

(He smirks.)
I swear, irony is the only renewable energy source millennials have left. You could power a small city with our sarcasm alone.

(A guy in the front row laughs loudly.)

Elliot (grinning): Sir, you sound like someone who’s already given up and found peace with late-stage capitalism. Congratulations. What’s the secret? Microdosing or denial?

(The guy fires back good-naturedly: “Both!”)

Elliot: Same, dude. Same.

(He takes a breath, gaze turning a touch more introspective.)

Elliot: You know, people sometimes ask me why I keep doing this kind of material. They say, “Elliot, you’ll never get a Netflix special talking about corruption and inequality. Why not tell jokes about dating?”

And I’m like—dating is political. It’s two people negotiating emotional labor, financial insecurity, and algorithmic capitalism while pretending to like each other’s Spotify playlists. Honestly, if you can survive a Bumble date, you can survive an economic recession.

(Audience howls. A woman shouts, “Facts!”)

Elliot: Exactly! Because modern love isn’t candlelight dinners—it’s Venmo requests and passive-aggressive memes. Nothing screams intimacy like splitting the check on a $30 salad.

(Elliot checks his phone exaggeratedly.)

Elliot: Ah, what’s that? My screen time report. Fun fact—it turns out I’ve spent three hours this week reading about the end of civilization and four hours arguing in comment sections with people named “FreedomDad1972.” So yeah, I’m thriving.

(He tosses his phone into his jacket pocket.)
But seriously, that’s what comedy’s become—therapy we can’t afford. A way to laugh while Rome livestreams its own burning.

(He pauses, lets the laughter fade into a thoughtful hum.)

Elliot: Still, I believe in laughter. It’s the only rebellion they haven’t taxed yet. Every time we laugh at the absurdity, we remind them we’re still paying attention—even if it’s between sips of cheap beer and existential panic.

(He raises his glass.)
To all of us still laughing at the end of the world.

(The audience cheers, applause loud and sincere. He bows slightly, smiling genuine for the first time.)

Elliot: Thanks, everyone. Keep questioning everything—even the punchlines.

(He waves, exits the stage. The MC rushes up, clapping.)

MC: Give it up for Elliot Vega, everyone! The only comic who can make you laugh and rethink your entire life in the same set!

(Applause swells; Elliot lingers by the bar, sipping water, half-smiling as the next performer—a nervous poet—takes the mic. Amid the chatter and laughter, the neon sign flickers again: “Speak Your Truth.” The world above keeps spinning, imperfect but still listening.)
