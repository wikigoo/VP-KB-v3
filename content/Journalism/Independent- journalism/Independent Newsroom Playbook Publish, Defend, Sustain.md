summary: "End-to-end operating playbook for independent newsrooms: infra, legal/safety posture, funding mix, verification, release, defense, distribution, trust, and advocacy."
---


This operational guide turns principles into repeatable actions. It’s designed for small, mission-driven outlets working under pressure—legal, financial, and reputational. The steps below are explicit, tooling-aware, and validation-driven, with concrete success metrics and common failure modes. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

> **Time budget (typical):** Initial setup 1–2 weeks; per-investigation cycle 3–12+ weeks depending on scope. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

---

## Prerequisites

- **Secure comms:** Signal (v≥6.x), Proton Mail/PGP, 2FA via authenticator app only.  
- **Core stack:** CMS (WordPress 6.x or Ghost 5.x), payments (Stripe/PayPal), CRM (Airtable/Notion), analytics (Matomo/GA4), password manager (Bitwarden).  
- **Policies:** Written ethics code (SPJ-based), corrections policy (timestamped & versioned), risk assessment template (legal + safety).  
- **Legal contacts:** 2+ independent lawyers + 1 press-freedom org on call.  
- **Funding horizon:** Treat institutional grants as **bridge** support (10–15y); diversify from day 1. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

**Why this matters:** Outlets that launch without hardened comms, an ethics/corrections page, or a risk form tend to over-rely on a single funder and face preventable exposure during first high-stakes publication. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

---

## Step 1 — Set Up Core Infrastructure

**1.1 Payments & membership**
- Enable Stripe live keys; default currency; $3 minimum; recurring on; test webhooks with $1 test product.  
- WordPress + MemberPress or Ghost Members works well; ensure HTTPS on webhook URLs.  
**Validation:** Complete a $1 test donation and confirm CRM auto-entry ≤2 minutes.  
**Common mistakes:** Live keys missing; webhook on HTTP; no recurring toggle.  
**Quick fix:** Rotate API keys; resend Stripe event. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

**1.2 CRM baseline**
- Create **Tips**, **Members**, **Sources** tables. Required fields: status, sensitivity (L/M/H), legal risk (0–3), consent (Y/N), comms channel, owner.  
**Validation:** New donation upserts a Member; tip intake form tags sensitivity.  
**Pitfall:** Free-form tags → chaos; **lock fields** with single-select. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

**1.3 Ethics & corrections**
- Publish a single policy page: SPJ-derived bullets; corrections must show **what changed + timestamp + link to prior version**; add **/corrections** to nav and template footer.  
**Time:** 2–3 hours.  
**Validation:** Policy live and referenced in article template. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

---

## Step 2 — Secure Legal & Safety Posture

**2.1 Rapid-response call tree**
- Store names, 24/7 phone, Signal, email, jurisdiction, and specialties (FOI/defamation/criminal) in a **shared, encrypted** vault.  
**Validation:** All contacts reachable in <10 minutes.  
**Anti-pattern:** Legal numbers buried in a random doc. Export an encrypted offline copy. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

**2.2 Harden comms**
- Enforce TOTP 2FA; disable SMS fallback; full-disk encryption; device autolock ≤60s; per-investigation Signal groups with safety words.  
**Validation:** Admin dashboard shows **100% 2FA coverage**. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

**2.3 Pre-publication risk form**
- Checklist fields: defamation/privacy/IP vectors, smear/harassment likelihood (L/M/H), physical and digital risks, mitigation owner per item.  
**Control:** Gate CMS “Publish” permission on a signed risk form. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

---

## Step 3 — Build a Sustainable Funding Mix

**3.1 Reader revenue**
- Offer **three tiers** ($3 / $7 / $15). Annual default. “Why it matters” copy ≤90 words. Quarterly A/B test amounts & copy.  
**KPI:** Initially ≥1% of readers see pay prompt; conversions ≥0.1%. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}

**3.2 Diversify with caps**
- Cap any single source at **≤35–40%**; track **reader %, ads %, sponsorship %, grants %, services %** on a monthly dashboard; alert if any source >40%.  
**Rationale:** Avoid editorial risk from funder concentration. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}

**3.3 Grants as bridge, not core**
- Maintain a 6–12 month rolling calendar; keep boilerplate + evidence library (impact metrics, cases); pursue consortia applications for credibility.  
**KPI:** ≥3 active applications/quarter with tracked win rate. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}

> **Reality check:** Reader revenue may remain modest in some markets; you still need a **hybrid** model and guardrails against funder dependence. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}

---

## Step 4 — Run Pre-Publication Controls

**4.1 Enhanced verification**
- Require one **independent corroboration per critical claim**; log method per source (doc/interview/data); maintain chain-of-custody notes for files.  
**Validation:** Verification log signed by fact-check lead.  
**Antidote to failure:** “Trusted source” ≠ sufficient; document corroboration anyway. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}

**4.2 Legal + security read**
- Defamation/privacy review; OPSEC check for doxxing vectors; assign mitigations with owners and due dates.  
**Validation:** All legal comments resolved before publish. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}

**4.3 Cross-border staging**
- Mirror drafts, evidence, and art with a partner outlet; agree on synchronized release.  
**Validation:** Offsite copy accessible; checksum verified. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}

---

## Step 5 — Publish & Defend the Story

**5.1 Radical transparency**
- Add **Methodology & Documents** box with timestamps and document links; include secure tipline contact.  
**Validation:** All evidence links open; timestamps visible and immutable. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}

**5.2 Rapid audience campaign**
- Pin cross-platform thread; publish a 60–90s explainer; include a “Find X” call-to-action.  
**KPI:** CTR ≥2%; video watch-through ≥30%.  
**Fix if missed:** Draft a 5-bullet social script before publish, not after. :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}

**5.3 Response SLAs**
- **≤4h** for credible/legal threats; **≤24h** for factual queries; abuse handled per policy (ignore/block).  
**Validation:** Response log shows on-time handling with links to replies. :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}

> **Expect retaliation:** legal letters, smear campaigns, and access blocks are common in constrained civic spaces—prepare counters *before* publishing. :contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}

---

## Step 6 — Activate Distribution & Local Reach

**6.1 Syndication**
- Pre-agree republication terms (e.g., CC BY-NC or partner license); use UTM parameters; deliver clean text + assets on embargo.  
**KPI:** ≥2 partner pickups within 72h. :contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}

**6.2 Low-bandwidth packages**
- Ship a 300–500 word brief, <1MB lead image, 60s audio cut, and an SMS headline ≤160 chars.  
**Validation:** Delivery confirmed for target channels; open rates tracked. :contentReference[oaicite:22]{index=22}

**6.3 Measure reach beyond capitals**
- Track unique reach, partner referrals, and geography distribution; target ≥20% audience outside capital cities. :contentReference[oaicite:23]{index=23}

---

## Step 7 — Maintain Trust Through Corrections & Openness

**7.1 Visible tip line**
- Publish a **/tips** page with PGP key, Signal number, and consent language; triage to CRM with sensitivity tags.  
**SLA:** Test tip → CRM in <2 minutes. :contentReference[oaicite:24]{index=24}

**7.2 Corrections & updates**
- Display “Updated: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM (TZ) — what changed”; link to prior version snapshot; enforce 48h correction SLA after a verified error. :contentReference[oaicite:25]{index=25}

**7.3 Public editorial Q&A**
- Hold a quarterly open meeting; publish notes and actions; track attendance and questions as community health signals. :contentReference[oaicite:26]{index=26}

---

## Step 8 — Review, Learn, and Advocate

**8.1 Post-mortem**
- 45–60 min debrief covering threats vs mitigations, verification gaps, legal follow-ups; capture 3+ action items with owners & due dates. :contentReference[oaicite:27]{index=27}

**8.2 Update templates**
- Rev the risk form and verification checklist; increment version numbers; notify staff in Slack/email; require the new version for the next cycle. :contentReference[oaicite:28]{index=28}

**8.3 Policy advocacy**
- Log meetings/submissions on ownership transparency, anti-concentration, and journalist governance rights; at least one coalition action/quarter. :contentReference[oaicite:29]{index=29}

## Implementation Templates (copy-paste)

**Verification Log (per story)**  
- Claim ID → Evidence (doc/interview/data) → Corroboration → Fact-check owner → Date signed  
- Chain-of-custody notes (file hash, timestamp, handler)

**Risk Form (gate for “Publish”)**  
- Legal vectors: Defamation ☐ Privacy ☐ IP ☐  
- Smear/harassment likelihood: L ☐ M ☐ H ☐  
- Physical risks: … / Digital risks: …  
- Mitigations + named owners, due dates  
- Editor + Legal sign-off: name, timestamp

**Corrections Block (story footer)**  
> Updated: 2025-MM-DD HH:MM (TZ) — Changed: [one sentence].  
> Previous version: [snapshot link]

**Syndication One-Pager**  
- License: CC BY-NC / partner terms  
- Assets: text (.doc/.txt), hero image (<1MB), audio cut (≤60s), social card (1:1 and 16:9)  
- Contact & embargo time; UTM scheme

## Best Practices & Anti-Patterns

**Do**
- Make *publishing contingent* on the risk form + legal read.  
- Invest in a **membership narrative** (what changes because readers fund you).  
- Mirror investigations with a **trusted cross-border partner** pre-release. :contentReference[oaicite:30]{index=30}

**Don’t**
- Depend on one benefactor; anything >40% is a governance smell.  
- Publish high-stakes investigations without a named **response captain** and SLAs.  
- Hide corrections in the CMS—**timestamp them publicly**. :contentReference[oaicite:31]{index=31}
