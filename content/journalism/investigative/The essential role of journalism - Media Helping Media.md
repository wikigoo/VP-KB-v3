![Image of an investigative journalist - created using Imagen 3 by David Brewer of MHM](https://mediahelpingmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/journalism.jpg) Journalism isn’t just reporting, it’s witnessing history, challenging power, amplifying unheard voices, and making sense of a chaotic world.

Journalism comes in many shapes and sizes. It could be general or specialist, opinionated or impartial, commercial or non-commercial.

It could appear in newspapers, magazines, radio, television, email, websites or social media.

The common element is the journalist, whose job is to collect information and prepare it for publication. It’s called telling the story.

At its worst, journalism is disgraceful. At its best, it is the foundation of  
an informed world.

Journalism is much more than just telling people what’s happening; it  
records history, assembles facts, seeks out diverse perspectives, tracks and  
influences societal change.

Here, at Media Helping Media we are speaking of **high-quality journalism**, the kind that is grounded in rigorous ethics, committed to facts over fiction, and substance over sensationalism.

**See:** ‘ [Why editorial ethics are important](https://mediahelpingmedia.org/ethics/why-editorial-ethics-are-important/) ‘.

This is journalism that informs society, shapes public discourse, and withstands the test of time. Its essential role can be best understood through twelve interlinked concepts:

### 1: Document of record

Journalism serves as a primary source of information about events as they unfold. Reputable news organisations strive to accurately record the ‘who, what, when, where, why, and how’ of significant occurrences.

**See:** ‘ [The questions every journalist should ask](https://mediahelpingmedia.org/basics/the-questions-every-journalist-should-ask/) ‘.

This creates a historical archive, allowing future generations to understand the past through the lens of those who witnessed it.

News reports, articles, photographs, and videos become essential documents for historians, researchers, and the public seeking to understand specific periods or events.

**See:** ‘ [Story development techniques](https://mediahelpingmedia.org/mangagement/story-development-ensuring-all-angles-are-covered/) ‘.

By meticulously documenting events, journalism helps prevent the manipulation or erasure of history. It provides a factual basis for understanding societal changes, political developments, and cultural shifts.

### 2: Observation of a ‘moment in time’

Good journalism captures the atmosphere of a particular moment. It goes beyond simply stating facts to describe the context, the emotions, and the human element involved in an event.

Through vivid storytelling, photography, and videography, journalists can transport audiences to the scene, allowing them to experience a sense of what it was like to be present. This provides a richer and more empathetic understanding of an event.

These ‘snapshots’ of time, preserved in news reports, offer invaluable insights into the social norms, values, and concerns of a specific era. They reveal how people lived, reacted to events, and understood their world.

### 3: Milestone in history

Certain journalistic investigations or pieces of reporting can become historical milestones in themselves. These are often the stories that expose significant facts, lead to social or political change, or mark turning points in public understanding.

**See:** ‘ [The investigative journalism mindset](https://mediahelpingmedia.org/investigative/the-mindset-for-investigative-journalism/) ‘.

Think of the reporting on the [Watergate scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watergate_scandal), the [Pentagon Papers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagon_Papers), or the coverage of [the fall of the Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union). These journalistic endeavours played a crucial role in shaping public discourse and influencing the course of history.

Such milestones demonstrate the power of journalism to hold power accountable, to give voice to the marginalised, monitor social and other changes, and to contribute to societal progress.

They serve as reminders of the impact that well-researched and courageous reporting can have, often acting as catalysts for significant societal shifts.

### 4: Factual reference point

At its core, responsible journalism is committed to accuracy and fact-finding. News organisations employ fact-checking processes and adhere to ethical standards to ensure the information they disseminate is reliable.

**See:** ‘ [Accuracy in journalism](https://mediahelpingmedia.org/ethics/accuracy-in-journalism/) ‘ and ‘ [Fact-checking and adding context](https://mediahelpingmedia.org/basics/fact-checking-and-adding-context/) ‘.

This commitment makes journalism a crucial factual reference point for the public. In an age of misinformation and disinformation, trusted news sources provide a foundation of verified information that individuals can rely on to understand the world around them.

**See:** ‘ [Dealing with misinformation and disinformation](https://mediahelpingmedia.org/advanced/dealing-with-disinformation-and-misinformation/) ‘.

Journalistic integrity and the pursuit of facts are essential for informed public discourse and a functioning democracy. When journalism acts as a reliable factual reference point, it empowers citizens to make informed decisions about their lives, their communities, and their governments, fostering a shared understanding of reality.

**See:** ‘ [Integrity and journalism](https://mediahelpingmedia.org/ethics/integrity-and-journalism/) ‘.

### 5: Public watchdog

Journalism acts as a crucial check on power in all its forms. By diligently investigating and reporting on the actions of governments, corporations, institutions, and influential individuals, it holds them accountable to the public.

This scrutiny can expose corruption, unethical practices, conflicts of interest, and abuses of power that might otherwise remain hidden. The threat of public exposure through journalistic investigation can act as a deterrent against wrongdoing.

**See:** ‘ [How to interview politicians](https://mediahelpingmedia.org/basics/how-to-interview-politicians/) ‘ and ‘ [The relationship between journalists and politicians](https://mediahelpingmedia.org/advanced/the-relationship-between-journalists-and-politicians/) ‘.

Ultimately, the ‘watchdog’ function of journalism is vital for maintaining transparency and integrity within society, ensuring that those in positions of authority are held responsible for their decisions and actions.

It gives the public confidence that they are not powerless against mighty institutions.

**See:** ‘ [Journalism and the public interest](https://mediahelpingmedia.org/basics/applying-the-public-interest-test-to-journalism/) ‘ and ‘ [Avoiding manipulation](https://mediahelpingmedia.org/advanced/is-your-journalism-open-to-manipulation/) ‘.

### 6: Voice of the voiceless

Ethical and impactful journalism actively seeks out and amplifies the stories and perspectives of individuals and communities who are often marginalised, overlooked, or silenced by mainstream narratives.

By providing a platform for these voices, journalism can shed light on social injustices, inequalities, and the lived experiences of those who are often excluded from public discourse. This fosters empathy, understanding, and can contribute to social change.

Giving voice to the voiceless not only informs the broader public but also empowers these communities by acknowledging their existence and validating their experiences, contributing to a more inclusive and representative public sphere.

**See:** ‘ [Diversity in journalism](https://mediahelpingmedia.org/mangagement/diversity-in-journalism/) ‘.

### 7: Forum for debate

Journalism plays a vital role in creating a space where different ideas, opinions, and perspectives on important societal issues can be presented and debated. Responsible news organisations strive to present a range of viewpoints, even those that are controversial or challenging.

By providing a platform for this exchange, journalism encourages critical thinking, allows citizens to understand different sides of an argument, and facilitates the formation of informed opinions. This process is essential for a healthy democracy where citizens can engage in meaningful dialogue and contribute to collective decision-making.

This function helps to prevent the dominance of single narratives and encourages a more comprehensive understanding of complex issues.

### 8: Agenda setter

Through the selection and prominence of the stories it covers, journalism has the power to influence what issues the public and policymakers consider important. By highlighting certain topics, investigations, or events, news organisations can bring them to the forefront of public consciousness.

This agenda-setting function can drive public discussion, shape political priorities, and ultimately influence policy decisions. It underscores the responsibility of journalists to carefully consider the impact of their coverage and to ensure a diverse range of important issues receive attention.

The ability to create or influence the agenda can be misused, but done responsibly it involves not only highlighting problems but also exploring potential solutions and fostering constructive dialogue around critical challenges facing society.

**See:** ‘ [Strategic forward planning](https://mediahelpingmedia.org/strategy/strategic-forward-planning-for-media-organisations/) ‘.

### 9: Information provider

A fundamental role of journalism is to inform the public about events, issues, and trends that affect their lives and communities. This includes providing factual information on topics ranging from health and education to politics, economics, and social issues.

By explaining complex topics in an accessible and understandable way, journalism empowers citizens with the knowledge they need to make informed decisions about their personal lives, their communities, and their participation in the democratic process.

This educational function is crucial for an informed citizenry, which is essential for a well-functioning democracy and for individuals to navigate the complexities of the modern world.

**See:** ‘ [Establishing a market differential](https://mediahelpingmedia.org/strategy/establishing-a-market-differential-with-original-journalism/) ‘.

### 10: Sense-making

In an era of information overload and rapid news cycles, journalism plays a critical role in helping the public make sense of complex events by providing context, analysis, and interpretation. It goes beyond simply reporting facts to explain the ‘why’ behind the ‘what’.

By connecting the dots, providing historical background, and analysing the potential implications of events, journalism helps audiences understand the significance and broader meaning of the news. This is crucial for fostering a deeper understanding of the world and preventing information from being overwhelming or meaningless.

This sense-making function helps citizens develop a more nformed perspective on the issues shaping their lives and the world around them.

**See:** ‘ [Adding context](https://mediahelpingmedia.org/basics/fact-checking-and-adding-context/) ‘

### 11: Community builder

Local journalism, in particular, plays a vital role in fostering a sense of community and social cohesion within specific geographic areas. By reporting on local events, issues, achievements, and the people who live there, it connects individuals and strengthens social bonds.

Local news outlets provide a platform for community voices, highlight local concerns, and celebrate local successes. This contributes to a shared sense of identity and belonging, which is essential for vibrant and engaged communities.

By keeping residents informed about local government, schools, businesses, and civic organisations, local journalism facilitates participation in community life and strengthens the fabric of society at the grassroots level.

**See:** ‘ [Audience research and segmentation](https://mediahelpingmedia.org/strategy/audience-research-and-segmentation/) ‘.

### 12: Catalyst for change

As highlighted under ‘milestone in history’, impactful and investigative journalism can be a powerful catalyst for social, political, and legal reforms. By exposing problems, injustices, and systemic failures, it can raise public awareness and galvanise action.

Such reporting can lead to public outcry, government investigations, policy changes, and even legal consequences for those found responsible for wrongdoing. The power of journalism to shine a light on issues can motivate individuals and institutions to take action and work towards positive change.

This catalytic role underscores the potential of journalism to not only document the world but also to identify trends, both positive and negative, and actively contribute to its improvement by holding power accountable and advocating for a more just and equitable society.

**See:** ‘ [Brand values in news](https://mediahelpingmedia.org/advanced/brand-values-in-news/) ‘.

In conclusion, journalism is far more than a vehicle for delivering news. It is an indispensable force for informed citizenship, democratic accountability, historical preservation, and societal stability and advancement. When practised with integrity, journalism strengthens our shared understanding of the world and empowers us all to shape its future.
