## AI art genres and styles

From creating hyper-realistic photography to avant-garde oil paintings, learn about the different AI-generated art styles and genres you can achieve using an AI image generator in Copilot.

## Art styles

One of the most exciting and fun aspects of using text-to-image models like [Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/?form=MA13KP) is that you can use them to generate images from any genre or style of visual art. Use photography, painting, 3D art, animation, illustration, and more as inspiration in your prompts. You can also mix and match different types of art to create hybrid or cross-genre images.

For example, you could write “paint a landscape in the style of Van Gogh with bright colors and swirling strokes.” Other keywords include oil, Renaissance, and watercolor. \[Please note: We encourage you to not reference living artists and their work in your prompts.\]

Other keywords include diorama and sculpture.

## Animation

Look to animation as examples or scenarios for your prompts, too. Use animation terms and techniques—such as motion, expression, character, or story—to describe your desired image. For example, you could write “create a 3D scene from an animated movie with a robot and a little bird.” Other keywords include *anime* and *Claymation*.

For example, you could write "draw a thin, light pencil sketch of a farmhouse with a big barn next to it.” Other keywords include *charcoal*, *pen*, and *marker*.
