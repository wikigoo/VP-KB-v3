![Image of journalists looking at a computer screen created with Gemini Imagen 3 AI by Media Helping Media](https://mediahelpingmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/earlydays.jpg) We are all data journalists, even those who may have never heard of the term before. Data journalism has been around for years, it’s just more accessible and useful now.

I can remember when I first realised I was a data journalist, or at least helping to produce data journalism.

It was in the summer of 1997 when we were getting ready to launch the [BBC News website](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news).  (And by the way, I don’t get any marks for being perceptive, because as we point out in the article ‘ [What is data journalism?](https://mediahelpingmedia.org/advanced/what-is-data-journalism/)‘, all journalists are data journalists, whether they know it or not, so I had been one since the 1960s.)

Anyway, we were looking at how to produce and improve news stories – and all our assumptions belonged in the analogue age.

We were obviously aware that unlike television and radio, online news was not an ephemeral, one-word-at-a-time medium. Users could dwell on text and be directed to other information for [valuable context and background](https://mediahelpingmedia.org/advanced/presenting-and-exploiting-content-online/).

We wanted to offer rich, instantly-available material that supplemented and enhanced every story.

But to produce that kind of material, we were used to relying on our own and our colleagues’ memories and archives, the BBC’s tape and audio libraries, a newspaper cuttings library and rudimentary newsroom systems that were not connected to the Internet.

In other words, it was a bit haphazard, almost certainly incomplete, relied on a lot of legwork and took ages.

Suddenly, as our tech guru patiently explained to us, we had electronic access to all kinds of valuable material. He called it “data”. The penny dropped.

We could automatically [link to related stories](https://mediahelpingmedia.org/mangagement/story-development-ensuring-all-angles-are-covered/). We could use search to produce the raw data for time-lines and fact files. We could pull down stories being written on primitive terminals in the BBC’s Moscow newsroom and automatically format them as web pages.

We even had a stab at a bit of software that would automatically create a timeline on important, recurring stories. It would search all our sources for, say, unrest in any particular country and produce a list of events.

To make the list usable, we had to instruct it not to put any two items too close together chronologically, unless they were very important, and to exclude items of lesser importance if the list was too long.

It was very ambitious and I cannot remember if we ever got round to implementing this functionality. If we did, then we almost invented an early version of artificial intelligence.

But now, the real thing is here, and the new capabilities that fascinated and thrilled us in those early years are now easily and freely available to everyone, in much more powerful versions, thanks to the power of large language models, neural networks and immense distributed computing power.

So now, not only are all journalists data journalists, we all have access to immense quantities of priceless data and the tools to make good use of it. We have listed many of those [data tools and resources](https://mediahelpingmedia.org/advanced/data-journalism-resources-and-tools/).

They are wonderful. But do not forget that in the term “data journalist” the second word is more important than the first.

We should all be thrilled and grateful for [the things Artificial Intelligence makes possible](https://mediahelpingmedia.org/advanced/artificial-intelligence-assesses-its-role-in-journalism/), but the most powerful tools are still the human journalist’s instinct, judgement and training.

This text offers a fascinating glimpse into the nascent stages of digital journalism, particularly the moment when the author recognised the inherent data-driven nature of the craft. Let’s expand on this, adding depth, meaning, and perspective:

### The ubiquity of data journalism

The assertion that “we are all data journalists” transcends a mere label. It’s a fundamental recognition of the information age’s defining characteristic: the sheer volume of data surrounding us. Even before the term gained currency, journalists were implicitly engaged in data analysis, sifting through facts, statistics, and records to construct narratives. The shift, as the author articulates, lies in the *accessibility* and *utility* of data.

### The analogue to digital leap

The author’s recollection of the BBC News website’s launch in 1997 is a powerful illustration of this transition. The limitations of analogue methods – reliance on memory, physical archives, and disconnected systems – highlight the transformative potential of digital data. The “tech guru’s” revelation wasn’t just about accessing “valuable material”; it was about recognising the inherent structure and relationships within information, the ability to connect disparate pieces into a coherent whole.

### Beyond automation

The ambitious attempt to create an automated timeline generator speaks to the early recognition of AI’s potential in journalism. The challenges faced – managing chronological proximity and prioritising information – are precisely the problems that modern AI and machine learning algorithms address. This anecdote is more than a historical footnote; it’s a testament to the foresight of those who recognised the need for intelligent data processing.

### The democratisation of data and tools

The author rightly points out that the tools that were once the exclusive domain of tech-savvy journalists are now widely accessible. Large language models, neural networks, and distributed computing have democratised data analysis, empowering individuals to explore, interpret, and visualise information in unprecedented ways. This democratisation, however, does not diminish the importance of journalistic ethics and skills.

### The enduring significance of the journalist

The emphasis on “journalist” over “data” is crucial. While AI can automate tasks and provide insights, it cannot replace the human element of journalism. The author’s “instinct, judgement and training” remain indispensable. This encompasses:

- **Critical thinking:** Evaluating the credibility and relevance of data sources.
- **Contextualisation:** Placing data within a broader social, political, and historical framework.
- **Ethical considerations:** Recognising and mitigating biases in data and algorithms.
- **Narrative construction:** Crafting compelling stories that resonate with audiences.
- **Human empathy:** Understanding and conveying the human impact of data-driven insights.
- **Accountability:** Holding power to account, even when the power is expressed in data.

### The evolving role of the data journalist

The modern data journalist is not merely a data wrangler but a storyteller, an investigator, and a communicator. They must possess a blend of technical skills and journalistic acumen. They must be able to:

- Extract meaningful insights from complex datasets.
- Visualise data in a clear and engaging manner.
- Communicate data-driven findings to diverse audiences.
- Understand the limitations and biases of data and algorithms.
- Use data to uncover hidden patterns and trends.

### A call for responsible innovation

As AI continues to transform journalism, it is essential to remember that technology is a tool, not a replacement for human intelligence. The focus should be on using AI to enhance journalistic capabilities, not to automate them entirely. The ethical implications of AI in journalism – including issues of bias, transparency, and accountability – must be carefully considered.

In conclusion, the author’s reflections provide a valuable perspective on the evolution of data journalism. The journey from analogue limitations to digital possibilities underscores the transformative power of data. However, the enduring importance of journalistic integrity and human judgement reminds us that technology is only as good as the people who use it.
