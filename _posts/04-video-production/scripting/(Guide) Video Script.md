# Practical Guide: AI-Generated Video Production for Iranian News Agencies

## Introduction: Navigating the New Frontier of AI Journalism in Iran

### The Dual Imperative

The advent of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents a dual imperative for news agencies operating within the Islamic Republic of Iran. On one hand, AI-powered video production offers a transformative opportunity to create engaging, high-quality content at scale, reaching a digitally-native audience that increasingly consumes information via mobile and online platforms.1 On the other hand, this same technology can be, and is, weaponized by state and non-state actors to produce sophisticated disinformation and deepfakes, further polluting an already challenging information ecosystem.3 For Iranian journalists, the adoption of AI is therefore not merely a technological upgrade; it is a profound strategic maneuver in a complex and ongoing information war. The central challenge is to harness AI's potential as a powerful tool for journalistic storytelling while simultaneously building robust defenses against its use as a vector for manipulation.

### Setting the Context

The Iranian media environment is one of the most restrictive in the world, characterized by a state monopoly on all television and radio broadcasting through the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB).6 Pervasive government censorship, coupled with a consistently low ranking in the World Press Freedom Index, creates a perilous landscape for independent journalism.6 Journalists face a high risk of arrest, interrogation, and imprisonment for their work.9 This state control is juxtaposed with a technologically savvy populace that actively circumvents these restrictions. Millions of Iranians use Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), proxy servers, and illegal satellite dishes to access banned social media platforms and international news sources.11 Studies on news consumption habits reveal a strong preference for online media, particularly news websites, social media platforms like Telegram and Instagram, and online search engines, especially among younger demographics.2 This digital-first, mobile-centric behavior establishes the clear strategic rationale for Iranian news agencies to develop an AI-driven video strategy that can deliver compelling, credible content on the platforms where audiences are actively seeking it.

### Guide's Objective and Structure

This guide provides a comprehensive, defensible, and security-conscious framework for the entire AI-generated video production workflow. Its objective is to empower Iranian news agencies to leverage this technology effectively and ethically, navigating the unique political, cultural, and security challenges of their operating environment. The following seven-step process outlines a disciplined methodology, from the foundational act of fact-gathering to the final certification of a production-ready script, designed to ensure that the adoption of AI enhances, rather than compromises, journalistic integrity.

## Step 1: The Bedrock of Truth: Fact Gathering and Verification in the AI Era

### Objective

The primary objective of this foundational step is to establish a verification protocol that is not only rigorous in its pursuit of factual accuracy but also resilient against state-sponsored manipulation and inherently protective of sources operating within a high-surveillance environment. In the age of AI, where synthetic content can be generated with ease, the bedrock of all credible journalism remains an unwavering commitment to verifiable truth.

### Key Activities

#### Reinforcing the "Discipline of Verification"

In an information ecosystem saturated with state-sponsored disinformation campaigns designed to discredit dissidents, erode trust, and control narratives, the traditional "discipline of verification" is the first and most critical line of defense.5 Before any AI tool is engaged, the raw material of the story—the facts—must be subjected to an uncompromising verification process. This process should be guided by the globally recognized standards of the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) Code of Principles. Adherence to these principles ensures a commitment to nonpartisanship, fairness, and methodological transparency, which are essential for building and maintaining audience trust.14 Every claim, statistic, and quote must be treated with skepticism and rigorously checked against multiple, credible sources.17

#### Advanced Source Validation for a High-Risk Environment

Standard source validation techniques, such as cross-referencing and checking a source's reputation, are necessary but insufficient for the Iranian context.18 The Iranian state actively surveils, harasses, and imprisons journalists and their sources, making the act of verification itself a high-risk activity.8 An accurate fact obtained through insecure means can lead to the arrest of a source, thereby compromising the entire journalistic mission and endangering lives.

Consequently, verification protocols must integrate operational security (OPSEC) as a non-negotiable component of journalistic ethics. The recommendations from the Arab and Middle Eastern Journalists Association (AMEJA) for reporting on Iran provide an essential framework.20 All communications with sources must be conducted using secure, end-to-end encrypted methods. All research data, notes, and source identities must be encrypted both in transit and at rest. Journalists must have a deep understanding of Iran's specific surveillance capabilities to protect their sources from state reprisal. Accuracy without security is an unsustainable and unethical practice in this environment.

A critical challenge emerges when applying international fact-checking standards within Iran. The IFCN's principle of "Transparency of Sources," which mandates providing all sources in enough detail for readers to replicate the work, is in direct conflict with the need to protect those sources.14 Publicly detailing sources as per the IFCN standard would be tantamount to exposing them to the authorities. Therefore, news agencies must adopt a modified, localized ethical framework. This framework requires transparency about the

_methods_ of verification and the _types_ of sources used (e.g., "a senior official in the Ministry of Economy," "a review of public procurement documents," "three eyewitnesses to the event") without revealing identities or specific details that could compromise safety. This modified policy must be clearly articulated to the audience to build trust based on methodological rigor rather than explicit source disclosure.

#### Cultural Relevance and "Red Line" Assessment

Facts must be assessed not only for their accuracy but also for their political and cultural resonance within Iran. Journalists operate within a landscape of unwritten but strictly enforced "red lines".7 These taboos include direct criticism of the Supreme Leader, questioning the legitimacy of the Islamic Republic as a system of governance, and challenging state-sanctioned interpretations of Islam.7 Crossing these lines can result in severe repercussions, including the closure of the publication and the imprisonment of its staff.10

The constant threat of reprisal fosters a pervasive culture of self-censorship, where journalists and editors avoid sensitive topics altogether.11 The fact-gathering stage must include a formal "Red Line Assessment" to analyze the potential political fallout of reporting a given fact. This is not an exercise in capitulating to censorship, but a strategic process of risk analysis. It equips journalists to make informed decisions about which stories can be told, how they can be framed to minimize risk without sacrificing core truths, and when the importance of a story justifies the inherent risks.

#### Fact Categorization and Contextualization

Once verified, facts should be categorized and contextualized. This involves organizing information thematically and building a narrative foundation that provides depth and nuance. For an Iranian audience, context is paramount. This includes historical background, economic data, and social trends that help explain the "why" behind the news. This deep contextualization is a key differentiator from the often superficial and propagandistic narratives presented by state media.6

### Deliverable: Verified Fact Sheet with Citations and Confidence Levels

The output of this step is a formal **Verified Fact Sheet**. This internal document serves as the single source of truth for the entire production team. It must be meticulously organized and contain the following columns:

- **Fact/Claim:** A concise statement of the verified piece of information.
    
- **Primary Source(s):** The original source of the information (e.g., official report, interview transcript).
    
- **Corroborating Source(s):** At least two independent, credible sources that confirm the fact.
    
- **Verification Method:** The specific technique used (e.g., document analysis, direct interview via encrypted channel, cross-referencing with academic studies).
    
- **Confidence Level:** A rating of High, Medium, or Low, indicating the level of certainty in the fact's accuracy. Only facts with a "High" confidence level should be used for sensitive or contentious reporting.
    
- **Risk Assessment:** A critical field noting the proximity to known political "red lines," potential cultural sensitivities, and an overall risk rating for publishing this fact. This formalizes the risk analysis process and ensures it is considered from the very beginning.
    

## Step 2: From Fact to Narrative: Ideation and Concept Development

### Objective

The objective of this stage is to transform the verified facts into compelling, visually-driven story concepts. These concepts must be strategically designed for the specific platforms where Iranian audiences consume news, grounded in the verified fact sheet, and developed with a nuanced understanding of the political landscape to ensure both impact and viability.

### Key Activities

#### Content Analysis and Audience Relevance Mapping

Ideation must begin with a data-driven understanding of the target audience. As established, Iranians, particularly younger generations, predominantly consume news through online and mobile channels, with platforms like Telegram and Instagram serving as major hubs for information dissemination.2 State media is often viewed with skepticism, and millions of users actively employ VPNs and other circumvention tools to access independent or international content.11

This behavior creates a unique strategic goal: the production of "VPN-worthy" content. For a user to expend the effort and accept the potential risk of using a circumvention tool, the content must offer significant value that is unavailable from state-controlled media. This value can be derived from credibility, a unique perspective, deeper analysis, or superior engagement. AI-generated video, with its potential for high visual appeal and rapid production, is a primary tool for creating this compelling, "VPN-worthy" content. Therefore, every concept must be evaluated against a simple question: "Is this story, told in this way, compelling enough to make someone turn on their VPN?"

#### Visual Potential and Cultural Contextualization

Not all facts are equally suited for video, and not all video concepts are suited for every AI tool. A critical part of the ideation process is assessing the visual potential of the facts and matching them to the appropriate AI technology. This involves categorizing potential stories:

- **Explainer/Data Visualization:** Stories based on dense economic reports, scientific studies, or complex bureaucratic processes are ideal for script-to-stock-video tools like Pictory. These platforms can quickly transform text-heavy articles into visually accessible videos with animated text, stock footage, and AI narration, making complex topics understandable to a broader audience.24
    
- **Breaking News Updates/Daily Briefings:** For rapid and consistent delivery of news updates, avatar-based platforms like HeyGen or Synthesia are highly effective. They allow for the creation of a branded news format with a consistent AI presenter, eliminating the need for a physical studio and enabling swift production cycles, which is critical for timely reporting.26
    
- **Reconstructions/Illustrative Narratives:** For stories where no cameras were present—such as a historical event, a closed-door political meeting, or a visualization of a future project—high-fidelity generative models like OpenAI's Sora or Runway's Gen-4 offer powerful capabilities. These tools can create cinematic, photorealistic, or stylized visuals from text prompts, allowing journalists to illustrate narratives in ways that were previously impossible.29
    

The choice of AI tool category directly influences the story's perceived authenticity and its associated risk profile. In a country where the state is known to deploy sophisticated disinformation, including deepfakes 32, using a photorealistic generative model like Sora for a sensitive political story carries a high risk. The resulting video could be easily dismissed by authorities as a deepfake or, worse, become indistinguishable from state propaganda, thereby eroding audience trust. Conversely, using a more stylized or obviously synthetic format—such as an animated avatar or a video composed of clearly sourced stock footage—for the same story transparently signals its nature as an illustrative report, not a piece of raw, unedited footage. This lowers the risk of misinterpretation and builds trust through honesty about the medium itself. The ideation phase must therefore include a "medium-message fit" analysis, carefully selecting the AI tool that best serves the story's journalistic intent and risk profile.

#### Developing Diverse Narrative Angles

Building on the expert guidance from AMEJA, it is crucial to develop narrative angles that avoid simplistic, binary tropes such as "regime vs. the people".20 Such framing is not only reductive but also politically inflammatory and more likely to attract negative attention from authorities. Instead, ideation should focus on developing more nuanced and defensible narrative angles that are grounded in the human experience. Effective angles include:

- **Focus on Human Impact:** Frame stories around the real-world consequences of policies on ordinary citizens (e.g., the effect of inflation on a family's budget, the challenges of a water shortage for a farming community).
    
- **Economic and Social Realities:** Develop concepts that explore verifiable economic data, public health trends, or environmental issues. These topics are often of high public interest and can be reported with a greater degree of objectivity.
    
- **Cultural and Historical Stories:** Explore Iran's rich cultural heritage or pivotal historical moments. These stories can foster a sense of national identity and provide important context without directly engaging in contemporary political battles.
    

#### Multi-format Optimization (16:9 and 9:16)

Concepts must be developed for a multi-format reality from the very beginning. The traditional widescreen (16:9) format remains relevant for platforms like YouTube and websites, but the vertical (9:16) format is the native language of the mobile-first platforms where audience engagement is highest.33 Vertical video is not an afterthought; it is the primary format for reaching the target audience. Storytelling techniques must be adapted accordingly. This means prioritizing a strong, captivating hook within the first three seconds to stop users from scrolling, focusing on a single, clear message, and designing visuals that are impactful within a vertical frame.34

### Deliverable: 10 Two-Line Script Concepts with Visuals and Engagement Ratings

The output of this step is a concise document presenting ten distinct video concepts. Each concept should be presented in a standardized format:

- **Concept Title:** A working title for the video.
    
- **Two-Line Script Concept:** A succinct, two-sentence summary of the story's core narrative.
    
- **Key Visuals:** A brief description of the primary visual elements and the proposed AI tool (e.g., "AI Avatar Presenter," "Generative B-roll of historical Tehran," "Animated data charts").
    
- **Target Format(s):** 9:16 (Primary), 16:9 (Secondary).
    
- **Engagement Rating (1-5):** An internal assessment of the concept's potential to capture audience attention and generate discussion.
    
- **Risk Rating (Low/Medium/High):** An internal assessment of the concept's political sensitivity and proximity to "red lines."
    

## Step 3: Architecting the Story: Script Structuring and Architecture

### Objective

The objective of this step is to translate a chosen concept into a detailed narrative blueprint. This architectural phase involves designing a structurally sound script, planning the visual sequence with AI generation in mind, and engineering the narrative flow to capture and sustain the attention of a mobile-first audience with short attention spans.

### Key Activities

#### Concept Analysis and Structure Diversification

A single, rigid story structure is insufficient for the diverse range of news content. This stage involves analyzing the chosen concept and selecting the most effective narrative framework to convey its message.37 Newsrooms should diversify their storytelling toolkit by employing various structures:

- **Linear (Chronological) Structure:** This is the most straightforward approach, presenting events in the order they occurred. It is highly effective for recaps of recent events, historical explainers, or biographical profiles where a clear timeline is essential for comprehension.38
    
- **Problem-Solution Structure:** This framework is ideal for investigative or explanatory journalism. The script first identifies and details a verifiable problem (e.g., air pollution in major cities, inefficiencies in a government service), then explores potential solutions proposed by experts, citizens, or through comparative analysis. This structure aligns well with standard explainer video templates and is powerful for driving constructive discourse.39
    
- **Human-Interest (Character-Driven) Structure:** This narrative approach uses a personal story to illustrate a larger, more abstract issue. By focusing on the journey of a single individual or family, the script can make complex topics like economic policy or social change feel relatable and emotionally resonant.
    

The choice of narrative structure can itself be a tool for risk mitigation. Direct, declarative statements about government failings or corruption are high-risk and likely to trigger a response from censors.21 A problem-solution narrative structure, however, allows a journalist to dedicate the majority of the video to objectively detailing a verifiable problem—supported by data from the fact sheet—without explicitly assigning blame. The "solution" portion of the narrative can then feature direct quotes from experts or testimonials from affected citizens, effectively outsourcing the more pointed criticism. This structure enables the news agency to report on sensitive issues while maintaining a degree of plausible deniability, framing the story as a piece of constructive journalism rather than a direct political attack. The narrative architecture thus becomes a form of journalistic self-protection.

#### Visual Planning for AI Generation

A script for AI video production requires a fundamentally different approach to visual planning. The structure must be conceived with the specific capabilities and limitations of AI tools in mind from the outset. This means creating a scene breakdown where each scene not only describes the narrative action but also specifies the intended AI generation technique. This proactive approach integrates production feasibility directly into the creative process, preventing the development of concepts that are technologically impossible or prohibitively expensive to execute.

For example, a scene breakdown might look like this:

- **Scene 1: Introduction.** _Narrative:_ Opening statement on the rising cost of bread in Iran. _Visual Plan:_ AI-generated cinematic shot (Runway Gen-4) of a traditional Iranian bakery, with a slow zoom onto a loaf of bread. Text overlay with a key statistic from the fact sheet.
    
- **Scene 2: Expert Analysis.** _Narrative:_ Economist explains the factors driving inflation. _Visual Plan:_ AI avatar of the economist (Synthesia), generated from a provided photo and audio clip, speaking the direct quote. B-roll consists of animated charts and graphs (Pictory) visualizing the economic data.
    
- **Scene 3: Human Impact.** _Narrative:_ A mother describes the difficulty of affording basic necessities. _Visual Plan:_ Anonymized, illustrative AI-generated visuals (Sora) depicting a family at a dinner table, with faces obscured or stylized to protect identity.
    

#### Engineering Engagement Hooks and Transitions

For mobile-first video, particularly in the vertical 9:16 format, the first three seconds are paramount. The average viewer's attention span is fleeting, and the decision to continue watching or scroll away is made almost instantly.35 The script's structure must therefore be engineered with a powerful "hook" at the very beginning. Effective hooks can include:

- **A Provocative Question:** "What if you could no longer afford to buy bread?"
    
- **A Startling Statistic:** "The price of this has increased by 300% in one year."
    
- **A Visually Arresting Image:** A dramatic AI-generated visual that immediately raises curiosity.
    

Beyond the hook, the structure must maintain momentum through rapid pacing, quick cuts, and clear, logical transitions between scenes. Each scene should build on the last, creating a cohesive narrative flow that guides the viewer through the story without confusion. The principles of effective editing—building tension and release, controlling the flow of information—must be considered at the structural level before a single line of narration is written.41

### Deliverable: Three Distinct Structural Frameworks with Scene Breakdowns

The output of this step is a document presenting three distinct structural options for the chosen video concept. Each framework will provide a different narrative approach (e.g., one linear, one problem-solution, one human-interest) and will include:

- **Framework Title:** (e.g., "Chronological Explainer," "The Human Cost Framework").
    
- **Narrative Arc Summary:** A brief description of the story's progression within this structure.
    
- **Scene-by-Scene Breakdown:** A list of all proposed scenes in order. For each scene, the breakdown will specify:
    
    - **Scene Number and Title.**
        
    - **Core Narrative Point:** The key piece of information or emotional beat to be conveyed.
        
    - **Proposed AI Visual Technique:** The specific AI tool or method planned for the visuals.
        
    - **Estimated Duration:** The approximate length of the scene in seconds.
        

This deliverable provides decision-makers with clear, viable options and serves as the definitive blueprint for the full script development in the next step.

## Step 4: Full Script Development

### Objective

The objective of this stage is to convert the chosen structural framework into a comprehensive, polished, and production-ready script. This final script will serve as the master document for the entire AI generation process, containing detailed dialogue and narration, precise timings, and explicit technical notes for the AI operators.

### Key Activities

#### Detailed Structure Analysis and Cultural Contextualization

Using the selected framework from Step 3 as a foundation, the scriptwriter begins the process of fleshing out each scene. This involves writing the full narration and any dialogue, ensuring that the language is clear, concise, and accessible to the target audience. The tone must be carefully calibrated to match the story's subject matter and the news agency's brand voice. Throughout this process, the writer must continuously cross-reference the Verified Fact Sheet to ensure every statement is accurate and defensible. Furthermore, deep cultural contextualization is woven into the script, using language, metaphors, and references that will resonate authentically with an Iranian audience.

#### Visual Planning and Scripting Dialogue/Narration

Professional script formatting is non-negotiable for ensuring clarity and efficiency in production. The script must be written in a two-column Audio/Visual (A/V) format.39

- **Visual Column:** This column describes everything the viewer will see. It includes detailed descriptions of each scene, character actions, text overlays (e.g., chyrons with names and titles), and graphics. Crucially, for AI production, this column will also contain the **AI Production Notes**.
    
- **Audio Column:** This column contains everything the viewer will hear. This includes the full text of the narrator's script, any dialogue from subjects or AI avatars, specifications for background music (e.g., "somber, minimalist piano track"), and any required sound effects (e.g., "sound of bustling market").
    

This format ensures that the visual and audio elements are perfectly synchronized and provides a clear, unambiguous guide for the production team.

#### Integrating AI Production Notes and Timing Specifications

The "AI Production Note" is the most critical component of the visual column and the core innovation of this workflow. This is where the scriptwriter translates creative vision into actionable, technical instructions for the AI model. A well-engineered prompt is the difference between a generic, uninspired output and a powerful, specific visual that serves the narrative. This guide recommends a structured approach to prompt engineering, based on established best practices 42:

**Prompt Formula:** `Prompt = Subject + Action + Scene + (Camera Movement + Lighting + Style)` 43

- **Subject:** Detailed description of the main focus (e.g., "an elderly man with deep wrinkles and a traditional wool cap").
    
- **Action:** What the subject is doing (e.g., "sitting at a small table, slowly stirring a cup of tea").
    
- **Scene:** The environment (e.g., "in a dimly lit, traditional teahouse in Isfahan, with intricate tilework visible in the background").
    
- **Camera Movement (Optional):** Cinematographic instructions (e.g., "slow dolly-in," "handheld tracking shot," "wide aerial shot").
    
- **Lighting (Optional):** The mood and atmosphere (e.g., "dramatic chiaroscuro lighting," "soft, diffused morning light," "warm glow from neon signs").
    
- **Style (Optional):** The desired aesthetic (e.g., "photorealistic, 4K," "35mm cinematic film look," "impressionistic watercolor style," "anime style").
    

Example AI Production Note in Script:

AI Note (Sora): An extreme close-up of an elderly gray-haired man with a beard in his 60s, he is deep in thought, his eyes focused offscreen. He sits at a cafe in Paris. He is dressed in a wool coat. Style: cinematic, warm color tones, soft lighting. 30

Alongside these notes, the script must include precise timing specifications for each scene and for the overall video. This ensures the final product adheres to the intended length for the target platform (e.g., under 60 seconds for an Instagram Reel).

#### Multi-format Compatibility Check

The final step in development is creating a "master script" that can be adapted for both 16:9 and 9:16 formats. The core audio and narrative will remain largely the same. However, the visual column should include specific notes for each format. For example: `Visual Note (9:16): Ensure primary subject is framed in the center third of the vertical frame to avoid being obscured by platform UI elements.` This proactive planning prevents costly and time-consuming reframing in post-production and ensures both versions of the video are optimized for their respective viewing environments.

### Deliverable: Complete Script with Timings, Visual Directions, and AI Notes

The final output is a single, comprehensive document: the production-ready script. It is formatted in the two-column A/V style and contains all necessary information for the production team to execute the vision, including finalized narration, precise scene timings, detailed visual descriptions, and meticulously crafted AI Production Notes for each generative shot.

## Step 5: Script Analysis and Evaluation

### Objective

The objective of this critical review stage is to subject the fully developed script to a rigorous, multi-faceted evaluation. This process is designed to identify narrative weaknesses, assess political and cultural risks, confirm technical feasibility, and ensure the script meets the highest standards of journalistic integrity before committing resources to production.

### Key Activities

#### Comprehensive Script Comprehension

The evaluation process begins with a thorough reading of the script by a review team, which should include a senior editor, a journalist with deep knowledge of Iran, and a technically proficient producer. The goal is to ensure a shared understanding of the script's narrative, message, and intended emotional impact.

#### Structural, Cultural, and Technical Feasibility Analysis

The script is then analyzed through three distinct lenses, guided by a formal evaluation rubric that draws from professional script coverage criteria and video production standards.50

1. **Narrative and Structural Analysis:** The review team assesses the script's core strength as a piece of storytelling.
    
    - **Clarity of Theme:** Is the central message clear and compelling?
        
    - **Logical Flow:** Does the narrative progress logically from one scene to the next? Is the pacing effective for the target platform? 41
        
    - **Engagement Potential:** Does the script have a strong hook? Does it maintain interest throughout? Is the call to action clear and effective? 50
        
2. **Cultural and Political Risk Assessment:** This is a non-negotiable checkpoint, led by the senior editor or an external consultant with expertise in the Iranian media landscape. The script is meticulously scrutinized for any potential violations of the unwritten "red lines".10 This review also assesses for more subtle cultural misinterpretations or nuances in language that could be inadvertently offensive or, more dangerously, be deliberately misinterpreted and exploited by state actors to discredit the news agency. This step is essential for the physical and legal protection of the journalists and the organization.
    
3. **Technical Feasibility Analysis:** The producer or technical lead evaluates whether the script's visual ambitions are achievable with the chosen AI tools. This involves a practical assessment of the "AI Production Notes." For instance, if a prompt calls for a complex physical interaction that a model like Sora is known to struggle with (e.g., a person taking a bite out of an apple and the apple showing a bite mark), the note must be flagged for revision.30 This analysis prevents wasted time and resources trying to generate impossible shots and ensures the final product meets quality standards.
    

#### Audience Engagement and Journalism Standards Assessment

The script is evaluated against the core tenets of journalistic ethics.

- **Accuracy:** Is every claim in the script directly traceable to the Verified Fact Sheet?
    
- **Fairness:** Does the script represent different perspectives in an even-handed way, avoiding binary tropes and providing necessary context? 20
    
- **Adapted Transparency:** Does the script adhere to the agency's modified transparency policy, being clear about methods without endangering sources?
    

#### Identification of Weaknesses and Improvement Opportunities

The final part of the analysis involves a **Deepfake and Disinformation Vulnerability Check**. This check acknowledges the severe limitations of current deepfake detection tools. Research and expert analysis consistently show that these tools are unreliable, easily evaded by sophisticated actors, and can produce ambiguous results that create more confusion than clarity.55 Relying on them as a primary defense is a flawed strategy.

Instead of a reactive approach, the script analysis must focus on _preemptive inoculation_. The review team must ask:

- Does the script's structure and narrative make it resilient to being mislabeled as a deepfake by malicious actors?
    
- Is the use of AI clearly and ethically signposted within the script's plan, for example, by noting where on-screen labels will be placed?
    
- Does the overall tone and rigorous sourcing reinforce the agency's credibility, making it harder for disinformation campaigns to gain traction?
    

This proactive approach, focusing on journalistic process and transparency, is a far more robust defense against disinformation than any currently available detection software.

|Tool Name|Type|Accessibility|Stated Capability|Documented Limitations & Expert Consensus|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Deepware Scanner**|Algorithmic|Free|Scans videos for signs of AI manipulation.|Performance drops sharply on new or "out-of-domain" deepfake techniques; can be evaded by adversaries who understand its methods. 55|
|**Sensity AI**|Algorithmic|Paid Service|Specializes in detecting deepfake videos and images.|Primarily enterprise-focused; limitations are similar to other algorithmic tools regarding novel generation techniques. 57|

### Deliverable: Script Analysis Report with Strengths, Weaknesses, and Recommendations

The output of this step is a formal **Script Analysis Report**. This document synthesizes the findings of the review team. It is structured into four sections:

1. **Overall Assessment:** A brief summary of the script's potential and readiness for production.
    
2. **Strengths:** A bulleted list of the script's strongest elements (e.g., "Compelling narrative hook," "Excellent use of data visualization," "Strong adherence to factual accuracy").
    
3. **Weaknesses/Risks:** A detailed, prioritized list of all identified issues, categorized as Narrative, Journalistic, Technical, or Political/Cultural Risk.
    
4. **Actionable Recommendations:** A clear, concrete set of recommendations for revision. Each recommendation should directly address a weakness identified in the previous section (e.g., "Recommendation: Rewrite Scene 4 prompt to simplify the character interaction, as the current version is beyond the model's capabilities," "Recommendation: Remove the phrase in line 22 as it comes too close to a known political red line").
    

## Step 6: Script Enhancement and Optimization

### Objective

The objective of this iterative stage is to systematically implement the recommendations from the Script Analysis Report, refining the script to elevate its narrative impact, strengthen its cultural resonance, and optimize its technical execution for the chosen AI platforms, transforming a good script into a great one.

### Key Activities

#### Review of Analysis Feedback

The process begins with the scriptwriter and key members of the editorial team conducting a thorough review of the Script Analysis Report from Step 5. The feedback is triaged, prioritizing revisions based on the severity and category of the identified risk. The hierarchy for revisions should be:

1. **Political/Cultural Risks:** Any changes required to mitigate potential "red line" violations or cultural missteps are addressed first. These are matters of organizational and personal security.
    
2. **Journalistic Integrity Risks:** Corrections related to factual accuracy, fairness, or sourcing are the next priority.
    
3. **Technical Feasibility Issues:** Addressing prompts or visual concepts that are not achievable with the available technology.
    
4. **Narrative and Creative Enhancements:** Improvements to pacing, dialogue, and overall engagement.
    

#### Narrative Flow and Visual Storytelling Improvements

With the critical risk mitigation addressed, the focus shifts to creative enhancement. This involves refining the script's rhythm, pacing, and emotional arc, drawing on established principles of film editing and narrative craft.41 This is not simply about correcting errors but about elevating the storytelling. Techniques may include:

- **Tightening Dialogue and Narration:** Removing superfluous words to make the script more concise and impactful, which is especially crucial for short-form mobile video.
    
- **Reordering Scenes:** Adjusting the sequence of scenes to improve the build-up of tension or to create a more powerful emotional release.
    
- **Enhancing Visual Descriptions:** Rewriting scene descriptions and visual cues to be more evocative, which will in turn guide the creation of more powerful and specific AI-generated imagery.
    

#### Cultural Amplification and Technical Optimization for AI

This phase involves a nuanced process of deepening the story's cultural relevance without increasing its political risk. It goes beyond simply avoiding "red lines" to actively weaving in elements that make the content more authentic and resonant for an Iranian audience. This could involve using more precise cultural terminology, incorporating culturally significant visual motifs (where appropriate and not cliché), and ensuring that all portrayals are respectful and avoid stereotypes, guided by the AMEJA principles.20

Simultaneously, the "AI Production Notes" are technically optimized. Based on the feasibility analysis, prompts are refined. A prompt flagged as too complex might be broken down into two simpler shots. A prompt that produced a generic result in testing might be enhanced with more specific details about lighting, camera angle, or artistic style. This is an iterative process of aligning the creative vision with the practical realities of the technology.

This continuous process of script revision and technical optimization leads to the development of an institutional memory. The team learns which types of prompts yield the best results from their chosen tools, which narrative structures are most effective for their audience while managing risk, and which visual styles align with their brand. This accumulated knowledge should be codified into a living internal document: an **AI Production Style Guide**. This guide becomes an invaluable asset, ensuring stylistic consistency across all video content, dramatically speeding up future production cycles, and serving as a critical training document for new team members. The optimization of a single script is therefore not an isolated task; it is an act of building a scalable, repeatable, and defensible production model for the entire organization.

#### Engagement Escalation and Quality Escalation Strategies

The final layer of enhancement focuses on maximizing audience engagement. This involves reviewing the script to identify opportunities to add interactive elements, such as posing a direct question to the audience in the narration to encourage comments. It also includes a final quality check on the language, ensuring the narration is powerful, persuasive, and memorable.

### Deliverable: Enhanced Script with Implemented Improvements and Optimization Roadmap

The output of this step is twofold:

1. **The Enhanced Script:** A revised version of the script with all the recommended changes from the analysis report fully implemented. This version is tracked to show a clear record of the revisions made.
    
2. **Optimization Roadmap:** A brief accompanying document that explains the rationale behind the key changes. It also notes any new best practices or successful prompt engineering techniques discovered during the optimization process, which can then be added to the organization's internal AI Production Style Guide.
    

## Step 7: Final Script Quality Control and Certification

### Objective

The final objective is to conduct an exhaustive, zero-tolerance review of the enhanced script to ensure it is flawless, ethically sound, culturally impeccable, and technically primed for production. This step culminates in the formal certification of the script, signifying its readiness and providing a crucial layer of accountability.

### Key Activities

#### Comprehensive Script Review for Perfection

The enhanced script undergoes a final, meticulous review by the senior editorial team. This is not a creative revision stage but a quality control check. The script is proofread for any grammatical errors, typos, or inconsistencies. All names, dates, and figures are triple-checked against the Verified Fact Sheet to guarantee absolute factual accuracy.

#### Message Clarity and Cultural Excellence Verification

A senior editor or cultural consultant performs a final verification to ensure the script's core message is unambiguous and that its cultural nuances are handled with the utmost care and respect. The goal is to confirm that the script effectively communicates its intended message without any room for misinterpretation that could be exploited by hostile actors.

#### AI Production Readiness and Technical Precision Check

The technical lead or producer conducts a final review of all "AI Production Notes." They confirm that each prompt is clear, concise, technically precise, and optimized for the intended AI platform. This check ensures that the production phase can proceed smoothly and efficiently, minimizing the need for trial-and-error during the AI generation process.

#### Journalism Standards Validation and Final Optimization

This is the ultimate sign-off on the script's ethical integrity. The review team confirms that the script fully adheres to the organization's journalistic standards, including the adapted IFCN principles for the Iranian context. A critical part of this validation is finalizing the **AI Ethics Protocol** for the specific video. This involves making a definitive decision on how the use of AI will be transparently communicated to the audience in the final product. Options include:

- A persistent, subtle watermark (e.g., "AI-Generated Visual").
    
- A clear statement in the video's introduction or conclusion (e.g., "The visuals in this report were created using generative AI to illustrate the events described").
    
- A detailed explanation in the video's description text.
    

This commitment to transparency is a cornerstone of ethical AI use in journalism and is essential for building and maintaining audience trust.60

This formal, multi-step certification process serves as a powerful tool for both internal accountability and external defense. The Iranian government frequently prosecutes journalists on vague, politically motivated charges such as "spreading lies" or "endangering national security".9 A rigorous, documented quality control and certification process creates a clear evidentiary trail demonstrating the news agency's profound commitment to accuracy, fairness, and ethical practice. If the agency's work is ever challenged by authorities, it can present this internal process—from the initial Verified Fact Sheet and risk assessments to the multi-stage reviews and final certification—as incontrovertible proof of its journalistic due diligence. While this may not prevent state action, it provides a robust defense in the court of public and international opinion and solidifies the organization's credibility as a trustworthy source of information. The internal bureaucracy of quality control becomes an external shield of integrity.

### Deliverable: Certified, Production-Ready Final Script

The final deliverable is the **Certified Script**. This document, having passed every checkpoint in the pre-production checklist, is formally "locked" for production. A cover sheet is attached, signed by the senior editor, lead journalist, and technical producer, confirming that the script has met the organization's highest standards of quality, accuracy, and ethical rigor. This formal act concludes the pre-production phase and authorizes the production team to commence AI generation based on the exact specifications within the script.

## Conclusion and Strategic Outlook

### Summary of Key Recommendations

This guide has outlined a rigorous, seven-step framework for Iranian news agencies to navigate the complex world of AI-generated video. The core strategic recommendations that emerge from this process are clear and interdependent:

1. **Adopt a Security-First Verification Process:** Journalistic rigor must be fused with operational security. Protecting sources through encrypted communication and modified transparency policies is not an optional extra; it is a fundamental ethical imperative in the Iranian context.
    
2. **Create "VPN-Worthy," Mobile-First Content:** Success depends on producing highly engaging, visually compelling video content that offers value unavailable from state media, optimized for the vertical formats of the mobile platforms where audiences reside.
    
3. **Select AI Tools Based on a Risk-Benefit Analysis:** The choice of technology must be a strategic decision. High-fidelity generative tools offer creative power but carry a high risk of being weaponized in disinformation campaigns. Avatar-based and script-to-stock-video tools may offer a safer, more transparent alternative for many news applications.
    
4. **Build Trust Through Radical Transparency:** In an environment of deep distrust, the most powerful currency is credibility. News agencies must be proactively and consistently transparent with their audience about when, how, and why they are using AI tools.
    

### The Evolving Landscape

The fields of generative AI and state-sponsored disinformation are evolving at an exponential rate. The capabilities of text-to-video models will continue to advance, while state actors will simultaneously develop more sophisticated methods of censorship, surveillance, and manipulation. Therefore, this guide must be treated as a living document, not a static set of rules. Continuous learning, adaptation, and professional development are essential for survival and success. Iranian news agencies should actively seek collaboration with international press freedom organizations, technology experts, and ethical AI researchers to stay ahead of emerging threats and opportunities.

### A Model for Journalism in Closed Societies

Ultimately, the framework presented here is more than a technical manual; it is a model for practicing resilient, ethical journalism in the age of artificial intelligence under authoritarian rule. The challenges faced by journalists in Iran are acute, but they are not unique. Newsrooms in other high-risk, closed societies are grappling with similar pressures. By prioritizing verification, understanding the audience, mitigating risk through strategic narrative design, and committing to transparency, this model provides a potential roadmap for journalists everywhere who seek to harness the power of AI to speak truth to power, safely and effectively.
