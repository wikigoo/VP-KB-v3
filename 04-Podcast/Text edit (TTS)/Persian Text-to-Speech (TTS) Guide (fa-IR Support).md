**Introduction:** Converting Persian (Farsi) text into natural-sounding speech involves unique linguistic considerations and technical steps. Persian uses a Perso-Arabic script written right-to-left and often omits short vowels in writing, which poses challenges for text-to-speech. This guide provides a structured overview – from language-specific preprocessing to using SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language) and selecting TTS engines – to help English-speaking developers and linguists generate high-quality Persian audio output. It covers Persian phonetics and orthography, text normalization (e.g. punctuation spacing, script normalization, zero-width non-joiners, diacritics), SSML usage for prosody and pronunciation control, supported TTS platforms (Google, Azure, Amazon, Coqui, ElevenLabs, etc.), troubleshooting common issues, and best practices for quality assurance. The goal is to ensure consistent, intelligible Persian TTS in applications, backed by accurate references and examples.

## Persian Language Primer for TTS

### Persian Script and Phonetics in a Nutshell

Persian is written in a modified Arabic script with 32 letters, including four letters not found in Arabic (پ /p/, چ /tʃ/, ژ /ʒ/, گ /g/). It is a cursive, right-to-left script; most letters connect to the next, and special formatting like the **zero-width non-joiner** (ZWNJ) is used to prevent certain letters from connecting within a word. For example, the prefix _mi-_ in _mi-ravam_ (می‌روم, “I go”) uses a ZWNJ to separate می from روم. Persian has **six vowel phonemes**: three short vowels /æ/, /e/, /o/ (typically not written with letters) and three long vowels /ɒː/, /iː/, /uː/ that are written using letters (ا or آ for /ɒː/, ی for /iː/, و for /uː/). The short vowels may be indicated with diacritic marks (see **Diacritics** below) in pedagogical or religious texts, but are usually left out in normal writing. Persian words are usually stressed on the **last syllable** (in the standard Iranian dialect), which affects natural intonation. Intonationally, a Persian phrase will often have a high pitch accent on the last stressed syllable, with a falling tone at the end of a sentence. This means TTS systems should ideally emphasize final syllables appropriately to sound natural.

**Consonants and Vowels:** Persian’s consonant system is similar across its main dialects, while vowel quality can differ slightly between Iranian Persian, Afghan Persian (Dari), and Tajik. In standard Iranian Persian (fa-IR), there are around 23–24 consonant sounds and **6 vowel sounds** (as noted above). Short vowels (a, e, o) are not written with dedicated letters – for instance, the word _ketâb_ (“book”) is written کتاب with only the consonants k-t-b and an optional diacritic for _e_ – while long vowels are written explicitly. This lack of written short vowels leads to **homographs** – different words spelled the same – which a TTS engine must infer from context or additional markup. For example, _sabk_ versus _sabok_ are both written “سبک”; with diacritics they can be distinguished as سَبک (sabak, “lightweight”) versus سِبک (sebk, “style/method”). Without diacritics, a TTS system might guess the wrong pronunciation. Persian also uses the **Ezāfe** particle (ـِ /-e/ or /-ye/) to link nouns and adjectives or possessives – this is spoken as a short “e” sound and usually not written out, which means a TTS might omit it unless the text explicitly includes a marker (more on this below).

**Diacritics (Harakāt):** Persian adopts diacritic marks from Arabic (zerʹe, zabar, pesh in Persian terms for kasre, fatḥa, ẓamme) to indicate short vowels or other vocal cues. These include **fatḥa** (ـَ) for /a/, **kasra** (ـِ) for /e/, **ẓamma** (ـُ) for /o/, as well as **sukūn** (ۡ) for consonant no-vowel, **shadda** (ّ) for gemination, etc.. In normal Persian text, diacritics are **seldom used** except in dictionaries, school texts, or to clarify ambiguity. However, they can be extremely useful in TTS input to ensure correct pronunciation. For instance, the ambiguous word _برد_ could be _bard_ (“stone”) or _bord_ (“win”); adding a fatḥa (بَرد) versus ẓamma (بُرد) tells the TTS which one to say. If a particular word is often mispronounced by the TTS due to missing vowels, consider adding the appropriate diacritic in the input or using an SSML phoneme tag (see **SSML for Pronunciation Control**). It’s important to use diacritics sparingly and consistently – marking only the words that need disambiguation – to avoid cluttering the text.

### Notable Orthographic Features

- **Multiple Letters for One Sound:** Persian inherited many Arabic letters that represent the same Persian sounds. For example, there are four letters for /z/ (ز ذ ض ظ), three for /s/ (س ص ث), two for /t/ (ت ط), etc. These spelling variations do **not** affect pronunciation in modern Persian – a TTS will pronounce ظریف and زریف the same way (“zarif”) despite different spellings. However, consistent spelling is still important for readability and for any text normalization pipeline (to avoid treating them as different tokens). Always use standard Persian spelling as found in dictionaries.
    
- **Zero-Width Non-Joiner (Nim-Fāṣele)**: The **ZWNJ** character is a crucial part of Persian writing. It appears as an “invisible” separator that prevents letters from connecting. In text, it’s used to preserve correct shape or meaning without adding a visible space. Common cases: between a prefix like _mi-_ (می) or _na-_ (نـ) and the main verb (as in می‌روم _mi-ravam_, “I am going”), between a noun and the plural suffix _-ha_ if the noun ends with certain letters (کتاب‌ها _ketâb-ha_, “books”), or in compound nouns to avoid unintended ligatures. For TTS, a ZWNJ can affect pronunciation subtleties: a full space might prompt a break/pause, whereas a ZWNJ keeps the word continuous. **Use ZWNJ instead of a normal space** when you want the TTS voice to treat two parts as one word without pausing, but you need to avoid a written ligature or binding. For example, _می روم_ with a normal space might be spoken with a pause (“mi … rom”) whereas _می‌روم_ with ZWNJ is spoken smoothly as one word. Ensure your input text has the correct ZWNJ in such cases to produce fluent speech.
    
- **Punctuation in Persian:** Persian uses many of the same punctuation marks as English, with some different glyphs. Key ones include **٫** comma (ویرگول) which looks like an inverted comma “,”, **؛** semicolon, **؟** question mark (mirrored “?”), and **!** exclamation mark. Quotation marks in Persian are usually Guillemets (« ») or English quotes depending on context. **Punctuation spacing rules:** In Persian typography, no space is placed before a punctuation mark, but one space is usually placed after (except immediately before a closing parenthesis or quotation). For example, one should write سلام! (”Hello!”) not _سلام !_. For TTS purposes, correct punctuation helps the engine determine sentence boundaries and intonation (a period signals a full stop with falling intonation, a question mark triggers a rising tone at the end, etc.). So, use periods, question marks, commas, etc., appropriately to break up text and guide the prosody. If a sentence is long, consider breaking it into shorter sentences or using commas/semicolons where a pause is intended – this can improve clarity in the synthesized speech.
    
- **Ezāfe and Formal Suffixes:** The _ezāfe_ (اضافه) is an unstressed _-e_ (or _-ye_ after vowels) sound that links nouns to their modifiers (e.g. کتابِ خوب _ketâb-e khub_, “good book”)[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/farsi/comments/g0t8mp/google_translate_with_persian_pronunciation/#:~:text=Yay%21%20That%E2%80%99s%20great%2C%20thanks%20for,%D9%85%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%B3%D9%87%D9%94%20%D8%AC%D8%AF%DB%8C%D8%AF%20%2F%20%D9%85%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%B3%D9%87%E2%80%8C%DB%8C%20%D8%AC%D8%AF%DB%8C%D8%AF). In writing, it’s often not indicated at all; readers infer it. Some writers optionally use a diacritic or a small hamza above the letter _he_ (ـۀ) or a combination of ZWNJ+ye (‌ی) to explicitly show the ezafe[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/farsi/comments/g0t8mp/google_translate_with_persian_pronunciation/#:~:text=Yay%21%20That%E2%80%99s%20great%2C%20thanks%20for,%D9%85%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%B3%D9%87%D9%94%20%D8%AC%D8%AF%DB%8C%D8%AF%20%2F%20%D9%85%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%B3%D9%87%E2%80%8C%DB%8C%20%D8%AC%D8%AF%DB%8C%D8%AF)[persianlanguageonline.com](https://persianlanguageonline.com/all-about-ezafe-part-1/#:~:text=All%20about%20ez%C4%81fe%2C%20part%201,e%20%3B.%20This). TTS systems, however, **will not pronounce an ezafe unless it’s present** in the text. This means if your text is “مدرسه جدید” (madrese jadid – literally “school new”), the TTS might say “madrese jadid” with a pause, missing the “-e-” in between. To fix this, write it as “مدرسهٔ جدید” or “مدرسه‌ی جدید”, including the ezafe marker, so it reads “madrese-ye jadid”[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/farsi/comments/g0t8mp/google_translate_with_persian_pronunciation/#:~:text=Yay%21%20That%E2%80%99s%20great%2C%20thanks%20for,%D9%85%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%B3%D9%87%D9%94%20%D8%AC%D8%AF%DB%8C%D8%AF%20%2F%20%D9%85%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%B3%D9%87%E2%80%8C%DB%8C%20%D8%AC%D8%AF%DB%8C%D8%AF). In summary, for any genitive or noun-adjective phrase that should have an ezafe, _either add the appropriate marker or be prepared for the TTS to potentially omit the linking sound_. On a related note, Persian distinguishes formal written forms and colloquial spoken forms (e.g., written _�ست_ “ast” vs. spoken _�ه_ “eh” for “is”). TTS voices are generally trained on standard formal pronunciations. If you feed highly colloquial spellings (like “خونه” for “خانه” meaning “house”), most TTS engines will still read it (often correctly, since it’s phonetic), but the tone will remain that of a formal voice. Maintaining a consistent register (using standard writing, and letting the voice’s natural style come through) is recommended for clarity.
    

## Text Normalization & Preprocessing for Persian TTS

Before sending Persian text to a TTS engine, proper **normalization** ensures the input is clean, unambiguous, and optimized for speech. Persian text may come with inconsistent Unicode characters, mixed numerals, or missing contextual cues. Here are the key preprocessing steps:

- **Unicode Script Normalization:** Convert characters to standard Persian forms. This includes using Persian-specific letters instead of Arabic variants. For example, use Persian ی (U+06CC) and ک (U+06A9) rather than Arabic ي (U+064A) or ك (U+0643) – the shapes may look similar, but the Persian forms ensure correct joining behavior and are standard for Persian text. Many libraries or regex replacements can fix this. Also, ensure hamzeh vs ye combinations (ئ vs ی) are consistent. Normalizing quotes and dashes to Persian conventions (e.g., using « » for quotes, – or ـ for hyphen) can help maintain consistency, though these may not affect pronunciation.
    
- **Standardize Digits:** Persian uses a different set of numeral glyphs (۰ ۱ ۲ ۳ ۴ ۵ ۶ ۷ ۸ ۹) but in digital text both Persian digits and Western digits (0-9) are common. Decide on a strategy for numbers: if the TTS engine is known to handle numeric strings in Persian, you can use either. However, many TTS systems might either spell out each digit or read a number as an English number if it’s in Western digits. To be safe, **convert important numbers to words** (e.g., “2025” → “دو هزار و بیست و پنج”) or use SSML `<say-as>` tags with `interpret-as="cardinal"` for that engine. For example, Azure’s SSML can interpret `<say-as interpret-as="number">2025</say-as>` in Persian. Keep in mind that a _persian_ voice may still attempt to read Western digits as Persian numbers, but testing is crucial. In any case, maintain consistency: don’t mix Persian and Western digits arbitrarily. Converting all to Persian digits (۰-۹) is a good practice if the engine supports them, as it signals the text is Persian. (If using a pipeline like Mozilla Coqui or other open solutions, a module like `num2words` for Persian can be used to pre-expand numerals[discourse.mozilla.org](https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/persian-farsi-tts/70498#:~:text=I%20use%20the%20num2words%20library,to%20help%20me%20add%20support).)
    
- **Expand Abbreviations and Acronyms:** Persian text may include abbreviations (مثل “د.” for “doctor”) or English acronyms (e.g. “UN”, “HTML”) embedded. Most Persian TTS voices will not handle English letters gracefully – they might be silent or mispronounced. Thus, spell out acronyms in Persian: either find the Persian equivalent (e.g., “سازمان ملل متحد” for “UN”) or transliterate them (for example, “HTML” could be written as اچ‌تی‌ام‌ال so the Persian TTS reads each letter in Persian). At the very least, insert spaces or hyphens between letters so the TTS doesn’t merge them. For abbreviations like “د.”, consider expanding to “دکتر”. Consistency is key: ensure the same acronym is treated the same way throughout to avoid one instance being clear and another unintelligible.
    
- **Punctuation & Text Segmentation:** Clean up the text’s punctuation. Ensure sentences end with a period (.) or appropriate mark (؟ !). This will cue the TTS to pause appropriately. Use commas (،) or semicolons (؛) in long sentences where a natural pause occurs. This not only helps human readers but also influences the TTS’s rhythm. If the text is a long paragraph, consider breaking it into shorter sentences or using SSML `<break>` tags (e.g., a 500ms pause) at logical points. Persian comma “،” and the Arabic comma “،” are the same Unicode (U+060C), and using a Western comma “,” typically will not break functionality (most TTS will pause on either), but for a polished workflow use the Persian comma for Persian text. Apply Persian question mark (؟ U+061F) instead of “?” – again, likely both cause a rising tone, but the proper character ensures correct text direction and rendering.
    
- **Apply Zero-Width Non-Joiners Correctly:** As noted, ZWNJ (U+200C) is critical in Persian writing. From a TTS perspective, a ZWNJ is not a pause – it keeps the word as one unit. So use ZWNJ in all the places it’s orthographically required to avoid the engine treating parts as separate words. Common scenarios: between a word and the enclitic _-am, -at, -ash_ (my/your/his) if the word ends in consonant (e.g., _ketâb-e man_ “my book” might be written کتابم without ZWNJ, which is fine, but _دوستم_ “my friend” ideally uses دوست‌م with ZWNJ to avoid the mistaken reading “doostam” as one fused form – engines differ on handling this). Also between verb prefixes (می‌ , نمی‌) and the verb. Ensure that your text has these; if not, adding them can sometimes fix slight pronunciation glitches (some older TTS might mis-accent the word if it’s incorrectly segmented). Conversely, **do not use a normal space where a ZWNJ should be**, or the TTS may introduce an audible pause or intonation break. For instance, “می روم” with a space could sound like “mi (pause) rom” whereas “می‌روم” is “miravam” continuously.
    
- **Remove Unsupported Characters:** Occasionally Persian text might contain decorative characters (like Kashida tatweel ― “ـ” used for stretching in calligraphy) or non-standard marks. It’s best to remove or replace these, as TTS engines might skip or stumble on them. Similarly, punctuation like _ellipses_ (…) should ideally be replaced with either a series of dots “...” or an explicit `<break>` in SSML for a pause, since not all engines handle the ellipsis character gracefully. Control characters or directional markers (RLM, LRM) can usually be removed unless needed for rendering. Keep the text plain and clean.
    
- **Case and Encoding:** Persian has no uppercase/lowercase distinction, so that simplifies one aspect of normalization (you don’t have to worry about case normalization). Just ensure the text is in UTF-8 encoding and properly stored, so that the TTS engine receives the correct Persian characters.
    

By performing these normalization steps, you prepare the text in a way that the TTS system can process it reliably. Many modern TTS pipelines include an internal “text normalization” stage that will do some of this work, but it’s often tuned for English or global use. Providing well-prepared Persian input reduces the chance of errors downstream.

## Using SSML for Persian TTS Control

**SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language)** is an XML-based markup that lets you fine-tune how text-to-speech is rendered, controlling aspects like pronunciation, speaking rate, pitch, volume, and pauses. Most cloud TTS services (and some offline engines) support SSML to varying degrees. For Persian text, SSML can be invaluable for adding pronunciation hints and managing prosody. Below are common SSML elements and patterns for Persian TTS, with examples:

- **Specifying Language and Voice:** In an SSML document, the root `<speak>` tag can include `xml:lang="fa-IR"` to declare the language as Persian (Iran). Additionally, many engines require you to choose a voice that supports Persian. For example, Azure Cognitive Services might use `<voice name="Microsoft DilaraNeural">` for a Persian female voice. Google Cloud’s engine does not currently have a Persian voice (and in fact, the `<lang>` tag for Persian is not supported on Google TTS)[cloud.google.com](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/ssml#:~:text=,if%20available), so in Google’s case you cannot synthesize Persian by just specifying language – there is no voice available (attempting `<lang xml:lang="fa-IR">...</lang>` on Google will result in silence[cloud.google.com](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/ssml#:~:text=,if%20available)). For Azure or other engines that have Persian voices, you usually do _not_ need to wrap text in a `<lang>` tag if you directly select a Persian voice – the voice’s locale is known. The `<lang>` tag is more useful when you have a multi-lingual voice or you want to momentarily switch languages (e.g. reading an English quote inside a Persian paragraph with a different voice). **Example:**
    

`<speak version="1.0" xml:lang="fa-IR">   <voice name="MicrosoftDilaraNeural">     سلام! به راهنمای تبدیل متن به گفتار فارسی خوش آمدید.   </voice> </speak>`

This SSML snippet greets in Persian. The `xml:lang` on `<speak>` and the specific Persian voice ensure the TTS knows to use Persian pronunciation. (On Azure, `DilaraNeural` is a Persian voice[help.webexconnect.io](https://help.webexconnect.io/docs/supported-languages-for-voice#:~:text=Pashto%20%28Afghanistan%29Neural%20ps,PL%20MarekNeural%20Male); on Amazon Polly, there is no Persian voice as of 2025, so this example is for engines that have one.)

- **Controlling Pronunciation with `<phoneme>`:** If a Persian word is pronounced incorrectly by the TTS or you need to spell out something phonetically, use the `<phoneme>` tag. It allows you to specify the pronunciation using IPA or another supported phonetic alphabet. For Persian voices, IPA is a good choice. For example, suppose the TTS mispronounces _ژوئن_ (June, a borrowed French word). You could write: `<phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ʒuˈæ̃">ژوئن</phoneme>`. This forces the engine to use the /ʒuˈæ̃/ pronunciation. Ensure the engine supports phoneme for Persian; Azure and others do support IPA phonemes for many languages[cloud.google.com](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/ssml#:~:text=%60)[cloud.google.com](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/ssml#:~:text=You%20can%20use%20the%20%60,of%20supported%20languages%20and%20phonemes). Keep phonemic transcriptions relatively broad (don’t over-specify minute allophones unless needed)[cloud.google.com](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/ssml#:~:text=There%20are%20up%20to%20three,be%20placed%20in%20a%20transcription). Use `<phoneme>` sparingly – maybe for proper nouns, technical terms, or disambiguation – since excessive phoneme tags can make SSML hard to maintain.
    
- **Adjusting Prosody with `<prosody>`:** Prosody covers speaking rate (speed), pitch, and volume. The `<prosody>` tag lets you set attributes like `rate`, `pitch`, and `volume`. For Persian, you might slow down the rate for clarity in something like an instructional context, or raise the pitch slightly for a question if the engine isn’t expressive enough. **Example:** `<prosody rate="slow" pitch="+2st">تلفظ دقیق کلمات بسیار مهم است.</prosody>` – this would say “The precise pronunciation of words is very important.” slowly and a bit higher pitched. Most engines have ranges or keywords for rate: e.g., `rate="x-slow"`, `slow`, `medium`, `fast`, `x-fast` or relative values like `-10%` or in Hz. Pitch can often be in semitones (e.g., +2st) or relative (`high`, `low`). Volume control (`volume="soft"` or `-3dB`) is less commonly needed, but can be used to soften a parenthetical phrase, for instance. Keep in mind that very slow rates or high pitch changes can make speech sound unnatural – test with the chosen voice to find sweet spots.
    
- **Emphasis and Say-As:** Persian TTS can utilize `<emphasis>` to stress a word or phrase. `<emphasis level="strong">تأکید</emphasis>` would strongly emphasize “ta’kid” (meaning “emphasis”). This might slightly increase volume or pitch for that word. Use it for words that need to stand out (maybe **Warning:** هشدار!). The `<say-as>` element is useful for telling the TTS how to interpret certain content. For example:
    
    - `<say-as interpret-as="date">1404/07/10</say-as>` might tell the engine to read the string as a date (if the engine supports Persian date formatting, it might read “ده مهر هزار و چهارصد و چهار” for 1404/07/10, which is Persian calendar perhaps – engines typically handle Gregorian dates more directly).
        
    - `<say-as interpret-as="digits">۳۲۱</say-as>` would spell out each digit (“سه دو یک”) if that’s desired, whereas `<say-as interpret-as="number">۳۲۱</say-as>` might say “سیصد و بیست و یک” (321). Check the engine’s documentation; not all have Persian-specific say-as formats, but many support at least characters, cardinal numbers, ordinal (1st, 2nd), etc.
        
    - For foreign words, you might use `<lang>` inside say-as if supported, or just `<phoneme>` as earlier. Some engines allow a <sub alias="..."> originalword </sub> to substitute a phrase – e.g., `<sub alias="سازمان ملل">UN</sub>` could replace “UN” with “سازمان ملل” in speech without changing the original text.
        
- **Pausing with `<break>`:** If you need a pause that isn’t naturally provided by punctuation, use `<break time="500ms"/>` (for a half-second silence) or `<break strength="medium"/>`. For example, in reading a list: `سیب<break time="300ms"/> پرتقال<break time="300ms"/> موز`. Be careful not to overuse breaks; rely on punctuation for normal pauses so that the TTS handles them. But for dramatic effect or ensuring a pause where the TTS might not do so (e.g., after an abbreviation that doesn’t end with a period in the text), `<break>` is very handy.
    
- **Example SSML Snippet:** Below is a cohesive example putting some of these together. It says a sentence, slows down for a certain part, spells a number, and emphasizes a word:
    

`<speak xml:lang="fa-IR">   <voice name="MicrosoftFaridNeural">     امروز <emphasis level="moderate">هوا</emphasis> <prosody rate="slow">بسیار سرد</prosody> است.     دمای هوا <say-as interpret-as="number">-5</say-as> درجه می‌باشد.      <break time="500ms"/>     لطفاً <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="xoʃɒːqid">خوش‌آیید</phoneme> را درست تلفظ کنید.   </voice> </speak>`

This SSML instructs the engine (with a male Persian voice Farid) to say: _“Emruz havâ besyar sard ast. Damâ-ye havâ -5 daraje mibâshad. ... Lotfan 'khosh-âyid' râ dorost talaffoz konid.”_ Key things happening:

- _هوا_ (weather) is moderately emphasized.
    
- _بسیار سرد_ (very cold) is spoken slowly for emphasis.
    
- “-5” is read as “manfi panj” (minus five) because of the say-as number (assuming the engine handles the minus sign and Persian number; if not, one might write out _منفی پنج_).
    
- A 500ms pause before the next sentence.
    
- The word _خوش‌آیید_ is given an IPA phoneme spelling “xoʃɒːqid” to ensure it’s pronounced in a specific way (perhaps the engine was mispronouncing it without the hint).
    

Make sure to consult each TTS vendor’s SSML support page, as there are slight differences in what tags or attributes they support. For instance, Google’s engine (if it had Persian) might not support `<prosody volume>` changes, or Amazon Polly might not support `<emphasis>` with levels beyond “moderate”, etc. Azure supports a rich set of SSML including `<mstts:express-as>` for styles in some languages (not sure for Persian yet). But the core W3C SSML tags above are generally supported.

**Note:** When using SSML, always validate that your XML is well-formed and the tags are allowed. Improper SSML will typically cause the TTS request to fail or be ignored. Some editors or APIs provide SSML validators. Also, some systems might require you to wrap the SSML in a certain tag or escape certain characters (like & or < in the text). Test with small snippets to be safe.

## Supported TTS Platforms (Persian Language Support)

When choosing a text-to-speech solution for Persian, it’s crucial to know which platforms have native support for Persian (_fa-IR_ locale) and the quality/features of their voices. Here is a breakdown of major TTS vendors and tools with respect to Persian:

- **Google Cloud Text-to-Speech:** **Not supported (as of late 2025).** Google’s TTS API does **not yet offer Persian voices or fa-IR support**, despite supporting many other languages. Persian is absent from Google’s official list of supported languages/voices[support.google.com](https://support.google.com/translate/thread/295782024/persian-text-to-speech?hl=en#:~:text=Hello%2C%20it%27s%202024%20and%20Google%27s,getting%20the%20same%20generic%20response), and user inquiries confirm that Google Translate’s TTS has no Persian option[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/farsi/comments/g0t8mp/google_translate_with_persian_pronunciation/#:~:text=A%20little%20while%20ago%20someone,Speech%20for%20Persian). This means you cannot directly generate Persian speech with Google’s TTS API. (Google’s Speech-to-Text does support Persian recognition, but that’s a separate service[github.com](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/202#:~:text=Persian%20%28%27fa%27%2C%20%27fa,but%20cannot%20use%20it).) If Google is preferred for other reasons, a workaround is needed – e.g., using an intermediary service or waiting until Google releases Persian. For now, plan on using another provider for Persian TTS.
    
- **Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services (Speech):** **Supported.** Azure offers **Neural TTS voices for Persian**. As of 2025, there are at least two high-quality voices: “Dilara” (female) and “Farid” (male) for fa-IR[help.webexconnect.io](https://help.webexconnect.io/docs/supported-languages-for-voice#:~:text=Pashto%20%28Afghanistan%29Neural%20ps,PL%20MarekNeural%20Male). These are neural voices that produce very natural speech. Azure’s Persian voices support SSML for prosody, pronunciation (IPA phoneme support), and even voice styles (though Persian-specific styles like “cheerful” might not be available, you can use neutral style). To use Azure’s Persian voice, you specify the locale `fa-IR` and voice name in the API or SSML `<voice>` tag. Azure’s documentation confirms Persian (Iran) support in its language list[help.webexconnect.io](https://help.webexconnect.io/docs/supported-languages-for-voice#:~:text=Pashto%20%28Afghanistan%29Neural%20ps,PL%20MarekNeural%20Male). These voices can handle Persian numerals and some basic English mixed in (like numbers or names) reasonably well, but for best results use the techniques discussed (say-as, etc.). Azure does not require special setup beyond selecting the voice – just ensure your text is in Persian script and properly formatted. The service will handle things like basic number reading and common abbreviations internally. Azure’s pricing for TTS applies to Persian voices as it does for others (per character basis for Standard/Neural). Latency is low and integration is via REST or SDK.
    
- **Amazon Polly (AWS):** **Not supported.** Amazon Polly, as of the latest update (Sept 2025), does not list Persian among its 30+ languages[docs.aws.amazon.com](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/supported-languages.html#:~:text=Language)[docs.aws.amazon.com](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/supported-languages.html#:~:text=Swedish). Amazon supports Arabic and Urdu, Turkish, etc., but Persian is notably missing. There have been no official Persian voices (either neural or standard) released on Polly. This means AWS’s TTS cannot directly synthesize Persian text. If you are using AWS infrastructure, you would need to incorporate a third-party TTS for Persian or perhaps use Polly’s neural voices in _other languages_ as a proxy (not ideal at all, since they won’t pronounce Persian correctly). In short, Polly is not an option for Persian until Amazon introduces support.
    
- **ElevenLabs:** **Supported (multilingual model).** ElevenLabs is a newer AI voice platform known for very natural and expressive voices, often used for content creation. ElevenLabs does not have language-specific preset voices; instead, their **Eleven Multilingual v3 model** supports generating speech in **74+ languages including Persian (Farsi)[help.elevenlabs.io](https://help.elevenlabs.io/hc/en-us/articles/13313366263441-What-languages-do-you-support#:~:text=,SRP%20Serbian)**. You can input Persian text and choose a voice (or even clone a voice) and the model will speak Persian in that voice. This is a multi-language model, so you could have one AI voice speak English and Persian sentences. The Persian capability of ElevenLabs is quite advanced in terms of handling the sounds, but since it’s a unified model, you might occasionally find certain words pronounced with a slightly odd accent or hyper-correctness. Still, it captures Persian phonetics and even some dialectal variation to a good extent[help.elevenlabs.io](https://help.elevenlabs.io/hc/en-us/articles/13313366263441-What-languages-do-you-support#:~:text=FAS%20Persian%3B%20POL%20Polish%3B%20POR,Bulgarian%3B%20CMN%20Chinese%3B%20HRV). Using ElevenLabs for Persian involves their API or web studio: you simply input Persian script (ensure it’s correct UTF-8 encoding) and select a voice. SSML support by ElevenLabs is limited; currently they emphasize plain text input with the model handling intonation. However, they continually update features, so check their documentation. If custom pronunciation is needed, you might have to respell words phonetically (e.g., by inserting Arabic diacritics or similar) since there’s no direct SSML phoneme tag as of last update. ElevenLabs is a great choice if you need a very human-like voice or voice cloning for Persian content, just keep an eye on their pricing (which is usage-based) and their terms for commercial use.
    
- **Coqui TTS (Open Source)** and **OpenTTS:** Coqui TTS is an open-source neural TTS toolkit that allows you to train and deploy your own models. Persian is **supported in the sense that you can train models on Persian data**, and indeed the community has created Persian TTS models using Coqui. For example, there are pretrained Persian models (female and male) available on Hugging Face[github.com](https://github.com/karim23657/Persian-tts-coqui#:~:text=Model%20Dataset%20vits%20female%20,dataset). These models (often based on architectures like Tacotron2, Glow-TTS or VITS with HiFiGAN vocoders) can be used with the Coqui TTS library to generate speech on-premises. The quality of these open models is improving; some are quite intelligible and natural, though possibly not as polished as big-tech offerings. The advantage is you have full control and can fine-tune on specific voice data (say you have a voice actor recording). OpenTTS is a sort of aggregator that can host multiple TTS engines (including Coqui, eSpeak, MaryTTS, etc.) behind a unified API. Using OpenTTS, you could run a Persian eSpeak voice (low quality robotic), or a Coqui model, or others. This requires more setup, but it’s **free and self-hosted**, making it suitable for research or offline applications. If choosing the open-source route, note you’ll need significant GPU resources to train high-quality voices. But if you have specialized needs (like a particular accent, or domain-specific pronunciation), this path is valuable. The community-run Persian TTS models show that it’s feasible to get good results without a corporate API[github.com](https://github.com/karim23657/Persian-tts-coqui#:~:text=%D9%85%D8%AF%D9%84%20%D9%87%D8%A7%DB%8C%DB%8C%20%DA%A9%D9%87%20%D9%85%DB%8C%20%D8%AA%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C%D8%AF,%DA%A9%D8%B1%D8%AF%D9%86%20%D8%A7%D8%B2%20%D8%A2%D9%86%D9%87%D8%A7%20%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%AF%D9%87%20%DA%A9%D9%86%DB%8C%D8%AF). Just be sure to verify the license of any model you use if it’s for commercial purposes.
    
- **Other Platforms/Tools:** A few other services have Persian TTS:
    
    - _IBM Watson TTS:_ IBM’s cloud does not list Persian among its supported languages (it supports Arabic but not Persian as far as known documentation).
        
    - _ResponsiveVoice JS:_ This is a web TTS library that hooks into either device TTS or available cloud voices. It lists “Persian Female” and “Persian Male” – under the hood these might use the browser or OS voices or some built-in voice. Quality can vary and it may require internet. It’s a quick solution for web apps but not as controllable as others (limited SSML).
        
    - _iSpeech:_ A smaller TTS provider that historically offered Farsi voices. If still available, quality may be basic. Use with caution and test.
        
    - _Balabolka / SAPI5 voices:_ On Windows, if you have Persian installed (sometimes there are SAPI5 voices for Persian, e.g., Microsoft had one older “Hoda” for Persian), you could use that for TTS. The modern Microsoft voices are part of Azure though, not freely on Windows by default.
        
    - _Festival/MaryTTS:_ These are older academic TTS systems. There was a Persian voice for Festival and MaryTTS (based on MBROLA or unit-selection) but the quality is outdated (robotic or very monotonous). They could be used for non-critical applications or as a starting point for alignments, but given the availability of neural TTS, these aren’t recommended unless you cannot use any of the above solutions.
        

In summary, for the **best quality** with minimal effort: Azure’s Dilara/Farid voices or ElevenLabs would be top picks for Persian TTS in 2025. If you need offline or custom voice, explore Coqui or other open models. Avoid Google and Amazon for now due to lack of support. Always verify the latest updates – TTS technology moves fast, and support for Persian could expand.

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting (Persian TTS)

Even with good preparation, you may encounter some recurring issues when generating Persian speech. Below is a table of common problems, their likely causes, and possible solutions or workarounds:

|**Issue**|**Cause**|**Solution/Workaround**|
|---|---|---|
|**Ezāfe not pronounced** (missing linking “-e” sound between words)|The ezafe isn’t indicated in writing (Persian text omits the short vowel for ezafe)|Insert an ezafe marker in the text. You can add the combining hamza over he (ـۀ) or a zero-width non-joiner + ye (‌ی) after the word[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/farsi/comments/g0t8mp/google_translate_with_persian_pronunciation/#:~:text=Yay%21%20That%E2%80%99s%20great%2C%20thanks%20for,%D9%85%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%B3%D9%87%D9%94%20%D8%AC%D8%AF%DB%8C%D8%AF%20%2F%20%D9%85%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%B3%D9%87%E2%80%8C%DB%8C%20%D8%AC%D8%AF%DB%8C%D8%AF). For example, write “مدرسهٔ جدید” instead of “مدرسه جدید” so the TTS reads _madrese-ye jadid_. This ensures the “-e” is voiced.|
|**Wrong vowel pronunciation (ambiguous word)**|Persian script lacks short vowel diacritics, so the TTS guessed the wrong pronunciation for a homograph|Add diacritics to clarify the word, or use an alternate word. For example, if the TTS misreads _پرداخت_ (pardaakht) as _pardokht_, write it with a fatḥa: _پَرداخت_. Alternatively, use an SSML `<phoneme>` tag with the correct pronunciation. Providing context in a full sentence also helps the TTS choose the right word by grammar (some advanced TTS do morphological analysis).|
|**Numbers read as individual digits or in English**|The number is in digits and the TTS isn’t formatting it as Persian (some engines might not handle Persian numerals or see Western digits as English)|Pre-format numbers: either convert them to Persian words (e.g., “123” → “صد و بیست و سه”) or use SSML `<say-as interpret-as="cardinal">` for that engine to spell it out. If using Western digits, ensure the voice knows it’s Persian context (Azure and ElevenLabs usually read “123” as Persian if voice=Persian). For years, you might also consider writing them out (۱۴۰۲ = هزار و چهارصد و دو). In cases like telephone numbers, use `<say-as interpret-as="digits">` or insert spaces between digits to ensure they’re read one by one.|
|**Foreign words or names mispronounced** (e.g., an English name in a Persian sentence sounds wrong)|The Persian TTS engine encounters a word in Latin script (or an unrecognized foreign term) and doesn’t know how to say it. It might spell it out by letters or just misapply Persian phonetics|Provide a phonetic Persian spelling or use SSML phoneme. For instance, “COVID” in Persian context could be written as “کووید”. If an English acronym must be spoken (say “UNESCO”), either spell it in Persian (“یونسکو”) or use `<phoneme>` with an IPA that approximates the English (but note the Persian voice has Persian accent phonemes). Another approach is to break the text and use an English voice for that word via an audio splice, but that complicates workflow. As a rule, keep the text in one script; transliterate foreign terms into Persian. Common names usually have standard Persian forms (e.g., “John” → “جان”).|
|**Unexpected pause or break in a word**|A space or incorrect joiner in the Persian text is causing the TTS to think there’s a word boundary|Use zero-width **non-joiner** instead of a normal space if you need to prevent joining without a pause. Or, remove the space if it shouldn’t be there. For example, writing “می روم” (with a space) will likely cause a break, whereas “می‌روم” (with ZWNJ) is smooth. Similarly “دنبال ه‎م” (incorrect space) vs “دنباله‌ هم” (depending on context) – ensure you’re not inadvertently splitting a word. Always double-check ZWNJ usage in compound words and after prefixes.|
|**TTS skips or spells out an emoji/symbol**|The engine may not know how to vocalize an emoji or special symbol|Provide a textual equivalent. Instead of “🙂”, write “لبخند” (smile) or remove the emoji in the TTS input. For symbols like % or $ in Persian context, replace them with words (درصد, دلار). This avoids the engine falling back to letter-by-letter reading.|
|**Inconsistent pronunciation across sentences**|Slight differences in context cause the TTS to choose different pronunciations (e.g., one time a word with ambiguous spelling is pronounced one way, next time another)|This can happen if the engine’s front-end guesses differently based on context. To enforce consistency, you might need to manually annotate the pronunciation each time (with diacritics or phoneme). Alternatively, if the engine supports a custom dictionary or lexicon, add the word with your desired phonetic pronunciation. Azure, for example, allows pronunciation lexicons in XML format. If not, ensure you consistently spell or diacriticize the word the same way in all occurrences so the engine doesn’t treat them differently.|

Each issue above can usually be resolved by intervening in the text/SSML. It’s a good practice to maintain a list of “problem words” encountered during testing, along with the fix you applied (such as a custom phoneme or a diacritic), so you can apply it throughout your content.

## Cultural and Linguistic Considerations

Designing TTS for Persian also means being mindful of cultural and dialectal factors:

- **Dialects (Iran vs. Dari vs. Tajik):** The focus of most TTS systems is **Standard Iranian Persian (fa-IR)**. If your audience includes Persian speakers from Afghanistan (Dari) or Tajikistan (Tajiki), note that there are pronunciation and vocabulary differences. For instance, the vowel /æ/ in Iranian Persian might be slightly more fronted or even [e] in Dari for some words; certain letters like و may be pronounced as [w] in Dari versus [v] in Iranian. TTS voices like Azure’s Dilara or Farid speak with an Iranian accent (Tehran accent), so they will pronounce ق and غ both as /ɣ/ (gh sound) and won’t differentiate [w] vs [v] (they use [v] for و). There currently are **no mainstream Dari-specific TTS voices**, nor Tajik (which is written in Cyrillic script). If you need to output voice for those dialects, an Iranian Persian voice is still intelligible to those listeners, but it may sound “foreign” or formal. You may want to adjust some word choices – e.g., use فهمیدن instead of متوجه شدن for “to understand” if targeting Dari, etc. However, doing dialect localization is beyond TTS – ideally, you’d use separate models. In summary, know that fa-IR voices speak Iranian Persian; use them for other dialect audiences with caution.
    
- **Formal vs Informal Language:** Written Persian tends to be more formal, while spoken Persian is casual. TTS voices will generally speak whatever is written in a standard, neutral tone. If you provide highly colloquial text (like using _تو_ instead of _شما_, or colloquial verb endings), the TTS will read them, but you might notice a mismatch in style – the neural voice will still enunciate clearly, which can make slang sound a bit odd. It’s usually fine to use either register, but maintain consistency. If your content is an article or audiobook, stick to standard written Persian. If it’s dialogue in a story or a conversational agent, you can use conversational style – the TTS will actually handle many colloquial contractions (e.g., _نمی‌خوام_ for _نمی‌خواهم_) quite well. Just avoid very slangy terms that the model might not know; or be prepared to define them via phoneme if needed. Also note, some polite forms like adding **“ـه‌است” vs “است”** (as in _گفته است_ vs _گفته‌است_) – the difference is mostly orthographic (with or without ZWNJ) and shouldn’t change pronunciation (both are “gofte ast”). The TTS will typically output the same speech for either, since the glottal stop before “ast” in very formal reading is often not articulated by modern voices. So you don’t need to worry too much about writing that ZWNJ in formal compounds like شده‌است in terms of speech, but do it for correctness and consistency.
    
- **Proper Nouns and Loanwords:** Persian has many loanwords from French, English, Arabic, etc. Proper names of people and places can often be of foreign origin. The TTS voice will apply Persian phonology to whatever is written. For Arabic-origin words that are common in Persian, this is fine (they’re part of Persian now). For newer loanwords, consider adapting their spelling to Persian phonetics. For instance, “Facebook” should be written as فیس‌بوک if you expect the voice to say it naturally. If you wrote “فیسبوک” vs “فیس بوک” vs “Facebook” – each will produce different results: the English word might be skipped or spelled, the Persian transliterations will be spoken and likely sound the same (decide on one form and use it consistently). Arabic names: Persian voices will read “علی” or “حسین” just fine (with Persian pronunciation, which might not have the exact Arabic sounds, e.g. “Hossein” with [h] not [ħ], which is expected). For a name like “ژان-کلود”, including the hyphen might break it – you might need to remove or use ZWNJ if you want a slight pause. Always test tricky names and consider adding a phoneme if the default is off.
    
- **Text Direction and Formatting:** Remember that any SSML or text you prepare might be in a system expecting left-to-right text. Ensure that UTF-8 encoding and proper BiDi (bidirectional) marks are in place if you mix Persian and English in one string. If you output SSML with Persian inside, the surrounding XML is LTR by default but the `xml:lang="fa-IR"` will signal to treat that segment RTL. It generally isn’t an issue when just feeding to TTS, but if you’re storing or displaying the text anywhere, you may need the Unicode Right-to-Left Mark (‎\u200F) in some cases to ensure correct display. This doesn’t affect speech but is good for any logs or subtitles.
    
- **Numbers and Units in Persian:** Culturally, Persian speakers use a mix of Arabic-script digits and Latin digits. If your text has units (like 10 km, or ۵۰٪), consider writing them out: “۱۰ کیلومتر” or “پنجاه درصد”. The TTS might not know how to say “km” (it could attempt “کی‌ام” or something). Writing “کیلومتر” is clear. For % sign, writing “درصد” is best. This also aligns with Persian linguistic norms (where writing out words is common in formal text).
    
- **Persian Calendar Dates:** If your application reads dates, note that Iran uses the Solar Hijri calendar (often alongside Gregorian). TTS engines won’t automatically know a date is Solar Hijri just from numbers. You’d have to explicitly add “هجری شمسی” or the month name, etc. For example, “۱۴۰۲/۵/۱۲” won’t be understood as 12 Mordad 1402 by any engine; you’d have to say “دوازدهم مرداد ۱۴۰۲”. So, be mindful of context if your text includes dates – they might need manual formatting.
    

Overall, cultural competence in the input text will lead to more appropriate output. The TTS will faithfully speak what it’s given; it’s up to you to give it text that is culturally and contextually suitable for your audience.

## Quality Assurance and Consistency in Persian TTS Workflow

When building Persian TTS into your workflow (be it for IVR systems, audiobooks, virtual assistants, etc.), it’s important to institute a quality assurance process to catch and correct issues early, and to maintain consistency across the output. Here are some best practices:

- **Proofread and Listen to Output:** Always **listen to the generated audio** (or at least critical sections of it) with a native Persian speaker’s ear if possible. What looks correct in text might still sound off. For example, subtle mispronunciations or unnatural prosody can slip through. By listening, you may catch that a word was stressed oddly or a foreign name sounded wrong. Take note of any issues.
    
- **Maintain a Correction Log:** Keep a simple table or list of words/phrases that needed special handling, and what was done (diacritic added, phoneme used, etc.). This becomes your custom pronunciation lexicon. For instance, you might log that “مایکروسافت” was being pronounced with stress on the wrong syllable, so you used a phoneme spelling to fix it. Ensuring this is documented means if the script/text changes or grows, you apply the same fixes each time that word appears. Consistency is crucial so that users don’t hear one name said two different ways in the same program.
    
- **Use Lexicon/Custom Dictionary Features:** Some TTS platforms allow uploading a custom pronunciation dictionary (for Azure, a Pronunciation Lexicon File in XML format). If you have many domain-specific terms (e.g., medical terminology, product names), leveraging this feature can be more efficient than sprinkling `<phoneme>` tags everywhere. For a given engine, you define the word and its phonetic pronunciation once, and the engine will apply it every time it sees that word. If available, integrate this into your QA process – update the lexicon as new problematic words are discovered.
    
- **Consistent Text Normalization:** Ensure the normalization rules you apply are consistent across all content. If you decided to use Persian digits everywhere, stick to that convention (don’t mix 123 and ۱۲۳ arbitrarily). If you chose a particular way to spell a borrowed word, use it uniformly. It can be helpful to run a script on your input texts that enforces these rules (for example, a regex to replace any instance of “%” with “ درصد”). Consistency in input will yield consistency in output.
    
- **Test on Multiple Voices (if available):** If you have access to more than one Persian TTS voice (say Azure Dilara vs Farid, or different vendors, or a new voice update), test critical sentences on each. Sometimes one voice might handle a construction better than another. For example, one voice might pause a bit too long at a comma whereas another is fine – you might then decide to adjust punctuation or add a slight tweak that works for both. Also, by testing multiple voices you ensure your SSML or text tweaks aren’t overfitting to one specific voice’s quirks. The VideoSDK 2025 guide suggests comparing outputs across voices to get the best result[videosdk.live](https://www.videosdk.live/developer-hub/tts/persian-text-to-speech#:~:text=,best%20results%20in%20your%20application).
    
- **Keep Sentences Manageable:** Long, run-on sentences can degrade TTS quality (the voice might lose the intonation pattern or breath). If any input sentence is extremely long (more than, say, 20-30 words), consider breaking it up in the text or adding an SSML break. Your QA pass should flag very long utterances. Sometimes, simply inserting a period and starting a new sentence (even if grammatically the original was a semicolon) can improve intelligibility.
    
- **Volume and Audio QA:** Check the audio output levels – Persian voices might have different volume characteristics. Ensure that the loudness is consistent if you are concatenating multiple TTS outputs. You might use an audio normalization tool after generation (like loudness normalization to LUFS). Within SSML, if one paragraph sounds quieter, you could use `<prosody volume="+2dB">` to boost it slightly. But generally, handle volume in post-processing or via engine settings.
    
- **Naturalness and Pauses:** Pay attention to where the TTS might be speaking too fast or monotone. Persian, like any language, has natural rhythms – maybe a slight pause before a clause, or a question tone at a certain point. If the TTS doesn’t do it naturally, you can insert breaks or even split a sentence and use an ellipsis. During QA, mark any spot you felt was unnatural and experiment with SSML adjustments to improve it.
    
- **Final Consistency Check:** Especially for large projects (like a narrated book or a long dialogue), do a skim listen of sections in order to ensure the **tone and pronunciation stay consistent** from start to end. Neural TTS voices are consistent by design, but if you mix different engines or voices, the difference will be noticeable. Ideally, use the same voice for all portions of a single product (don’t swap voices unless it’s a multi-character scenario). If you must use multiple voices (e.g., if one voice mispronounces a particular word badly and you use another for that word), try to match their speaking rate and style using SSML so the switch is less jarring.
    
- **Cultural Review:** As a last step, have a native Persian speaker or linguist review the final audio or the final SSML-laden text, if possible. They might catch if something is off idiomatically or if a certain phrase could be said in a better way. TTS can be literal; ensuring the script itself is well-written in Persian is part of QA. For example, maybe you used a very Arabic-origin word that a general audience might not understand easily when heard – a reviewer might suggest a simpler synonym.
    

In summary, treat the TTS output like any narrated content – review it critically. With Persian being a less commonly supported language, the onus is on the developer to fine-tune and correct as needed. But by following the guidelines above, you can achieve a high-quality, natural-sounding Persian voice output that reliably conveys your text’s intent. Consistent processes and careful listening are key; your users will appreciate the clarity and professionalism of the result[videosdk.live](https://www.videosdk.live/developer-hub/tts/persian-text-to-speech#:~:text=,best%20results%20in%20your%20application)[videosdk.live](https://www.videosdk.live/developer-hub/tts/persian-text-to-speech#:~:text=quality.%20,best%20results%20in%20your%20application).
