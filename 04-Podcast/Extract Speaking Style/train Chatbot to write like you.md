## 4 key elements that make up your writing style

Broadly speaking, your writing style is made up of four key elements: 

- **Voice** refers to the way you "sound" on the page. For example, if you use a lot of colloquialisms, your voice may be informal or conversational. Or, if you use more Shakespeare-like language, your voice may be more theatrical.   
    
- **Tone** refers to the attitude conveyed in your writing toward the subject or audience. If your writing is filled with a lot of rhetorical questions and irony, that might convey a sarcastic tone. Or if you include a lot of jokes and silly analogies, it may be more playful. 
    
- **Style** encompasses both voice and tone but also includes the specific choices you make in language and sentence structure. For example, you may opt for a minimalist approach to writing—get the message across in as few words as possible. 
    
- **Structure** refers to more than just the intro, body, and conclusion. It's how you organize everything in your writing, from word order to paragraph flow. For example, maybe your writing always follows a linear format (this happened, and then this happened). Or it might jump around in time. 
    

## How to find your writing style using Ai ChatBot 

Before you can train  Ai ChatBot  on your writing style, you need to be able to describe your writing style. Ironically,  Ai ChatBot  is the perfect partner to help you identify this. Here's how.

1. **Gather your most you-like content.** Identify three to five pieces of written content that reflect your true voice or the voice you want to train  Ai ChatBot  on. If you have digital copies of each, even better—you'll feed them to  Ai ChatBot  in the next step. 
    
2. **Ask  Ai ChatBot  to analyze your writing**. Feed  Ai ChatBot  with a copy of one of your pieces, and ask it to analyze your writing style. It's worth mentioning that, depending on the model you're using, you can paste roughly 100,000 words at a time. But that should be more than enough. Here's a prompt you can use: 
   
    ```
    _[Paste your content]_
    
    _Analyze the writing voice, tone, and structure of the article above. Output bullet points._
     ```


    Or, if your content lives online, you can paste the URL to all your articles and use this prompt: 
    
```
    _[Insert links to articles]_ 
    
    _Analyze the writing voice, tone, and structure of each article linked above. Output bullet points._
```

---
1. **Repeat**. If  Ai ChatBot  is analyzing one piece of content at a time, repeat the above steps for every article you've identified.
