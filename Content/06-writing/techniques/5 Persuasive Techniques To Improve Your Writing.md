Writing is an essential skill in many professions. Your ability to write persuasively can enhance your resume, email communications, written proposals and other important documents throughout your career. For this reason, it’s crucial to develop your persuasive writing skills and become the most effective and versatile employee you can be. In this article, we’ll help you with your written business communications by offering a list of persuasive techniques.

## Why is it important to be persuasive in business communication?

Whether you’re looking to gain website traffic or just the esteem of your coworkers and managers, persuasion is an important skill to possess. Being persuasive makes it easier for you to get things done because you can guide others to your way of thinking. Written communications play a significant role in business. Something as simple as sending an email to a manager or [writing a memo](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/memo-writing-guide) can be an opportunity for persuasive writing. If you’re in a sales role, it’s even more essential that you demonstrate these effective techniques for writing a compelling proposal because your performance may be tied to how convincing you can be.

## Five persuasive techniques

Here are five persuasive techniques for business writing:

### 1\. Establish trust and develop credibility

Persuasive writing involves connecting with your audience in an authentic way. Using techniques that build trust is one crucial way of connecting. An audience is more likely to see you as an authority on a subject if they trust you, and that’s essential for establishing credibility.For example, if someone you have never met before introduces themselves and in the same sentence offers a [sales pitch](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/a-sales-pitch), it may make you feel uncomfortable. This person hasn’t taken any time to explain who they are, why they are talking to you or what it is they want you to invest in.A good starting point in developing trust and authority is to ask yourself some questions before you start writing:
- Who?: A question such as “Who is my target audience?” or “Who am I to my audience?” can help you establish a credible tone.
- What?: “What is it I want my readers to believe in?” or “What are the best ways to appeal to this audience?” are important questions to ask yourself ahead of writing.
- Where?: The question, “Where will this document be used?” can help you gauge your persuasive writing style. For example, a technical document that will be used to train call center workers will require you to write differently than if you are writing copy for a travel brochure, but both should be persuasive.
- When?: Persuasive writing is often about the “when.” Considering your sales cycle, for instance, can help you write an influential proposal document.“When do I want to secure buy-in?”
- Why?: Before you start writing, ensure you fully understand why you are writing a persuasive document at all.
- How?: What you write is important, but so is how you deliver it. Establishing how in advance helps you avoid writing a letter in a scenario that would be better handled by a face-to-face discussion or phone call.
Consider the entire scope of your persuasive writing project before you launch. It is not only a good pre-writing practice, but it also establishes trust between you and your audience by answering all of their questions before they ask them. Once you’ve outlined the answers to some basic questions, consider these techniques for connecting with your audience and establishing credibility:
1. Appealing to emotion: Connecting with people emotionally is one way to write persuasively. You see this often in commercials for nonprofits that ask you to donate to save an animal or feed a family a holiday meal. Making an emotional appeal gets attention and connects with people at a visceral level.
2. Appealing to authority: When you can point to an expert opinion on a subject, people are more likely to find it credible. For instance, if you’re writing a blog on budgeting and personal finance, people are likely to believe you if you cite the experiences of other well-known finance bloggers that support your premise, rather than speaking entirely from personal experience.

### 2\. Understand the reader’s purpose and align your own

Understanding the intent of your audience is a big theme in today’s thriving [content marketing](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/what-is-content-marketing) industry. Consider your favorite search engine’s primary imperative is to know what you mean when you search a term. If you type in “Jasmine,” for instance, your search engine is programmed to decide if you are seeking information on the flower, the name or looking for a specific literary character.Content writers should think like a search engine. Consider why people are accessing your content and what they are seeking when they do. It provides context as to what you should write to be informative and persuasive. For instance, if you know your readers are looking for ways to backpack across Europe on a budget, you might recommend low-cost hostels over resort-style accommodations. This builds trust and credibility.

### 3\. Pay attention to language

The language you use can make your writing more persuasive as it impacts your ability to connect with your audience in a meaningful way. Here are some basic literary techniques and examples to consider for a more persuasive outcome:
- Flattery: “You’re smart, so I probably don’t have to tell you that it’s important to maintain a personal budget.”
- Hyperbole: “You simply won’t find a better budgeting template.”
- Speak to the reader: “If you’ve come across my blog, you’re probably looking for some budgeting help.”
- Active language: “Join me for this webinar on smart budgeting tips.”
- Use actual [statistics](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/what-is-statistics): “More than 80% of middle-class people live paycheck to paycheck.”

### 4\. Consider tone

Your [tone](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/examples-of-tone) determines how your writing comes across to the reader. Your tone may be authoritative, logical, passionate, humorous, intelligent or neutral. There are several ways your writing can convey tone, but when you’re writing to be persuasive, you should carefully select techniques and language that reflect a tone favorable to your reader.For example, if you want to present a tone that says you are an authority on the subject, some words you might use to discern your tone might be formal, knowledgeable, intellectual and written for clarity. You can also list tonal qualities you want to avoid. For example, you may want to avoid coming across as abrasive, terse or overly casual, unless your readers are expecting that tone from you.These defining qualities should help you determine which literary devices to use and what language is most appropriate for your audience.Related: [Guide To Submitting a Writing Sample](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/guide-to-submitting-a-writing-sample)

### 5\. Use rhetoric and repetition

Two techniques that are important for connecting with audiences in a persuasive way are repetition and rhetorical questions.When writing for repetition, you should carefully frame your work so that it’s engaging rather than redundant. After all, repetition is an important resource that can be emphatic and help illustrate a point. We see this in the following passage: “Your money is important. Your budget helps you safeguard your money. Therefore your budget is important.” Several keywords are repeated in this sentence to emphasize the importance of budgeting when it comes to optimizing your spending. Here’s another example: “A budget template is a template used for budgeting.” In this example, the sentence is redundant and the use of repeat phrasing doesn’t add any important meaning. To avoid writing redundantly, be intentional with how you use repetition. One technique for incorporating persuasive repetition is to use a rhetorical question. A rhetorical question is an obvious question that is meant to be emphatic. It’s a writing device that allows you to move your writing along toward a certain theme or conclusion.Here’s an example of a rhetorical question: “What’s better than having money in the bank?” When a writer uses a question like this, they are emphasizing a key theme that will likely be repeated throughout the work.Related: [Types of Questions: Definitions and Examples](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/types-of-questions)
