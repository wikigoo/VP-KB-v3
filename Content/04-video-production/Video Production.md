Video production is the overarching term for the entire process of creating a video. If you’re being especially specific, “production” may refer only to the part of the process where you’re shooting the content itself—you’ll see that section below. But in most cases, video production refers to everything that goes into the process: ideation, planning, shooting and execution, editing, and more.

Video production is impossible to ignore in today’s media landscape. You see the outcome of video production projects everywhere: in the commercials you see on TV and streaming apps, as social media ads, on [digital billboards](https://www.lemonlight.com/blog/out-of-home-ooh-media-is-going-digital-what-that-means-for-consumers-and-advertisers/), on video-first platforms like [YouTube](https://www.lemonlight.com/blog/youtube-seo-strategy-tips-to-boost-your-search-ranking/) and [TikTok](https://www.lemonlight.com/blog/best-practices-for-video-content-on-tiktok/), in marketing emails, in the metaverse, and virtually anywhere else dynamic content can be shared.

Video production matters because it *works*. Marketers and content creators have embraced the power of video for [every stage of the marketing funnel](https://www.lemonlight.com/blog/the-right-video-content-for-your-marketing-funnel/). They use video content to attract new audiences, engage existing audiences, drive conversions for physical and digital products and services, and boost loyalty among existing customers or followers.

No matter what your business goals are, video is likely the best tool to help you achieve them.

Here are just a few [video marketing stats](https://www.lemonlight.com/blog/67-video-marketing-stats-you-need-to-know-for-2023/) that highlight its efficacy:

In other words, you’ll walk away with all the tools to create a beautiful, effective video to transform your marketing efforts. Once you embrace the world of video production, you’ll never go back!

[Pre-production](https://www.lemonlight.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-video-pre-production/) is the first major phase of the production process. It’s the part of the process where you’ll get clear on your goals for the video and make all the necessary plans to get you to production day.

Check out the sections below for a deeper dive into this part of the process!

The first—and most important—step of any video production is getting clear on your video’s purpose. Why? A video that’s intended to drive sales for one product on Instagram will look *very* different from a video that’s intended to educate viewers about your industry at a conference.

A great way to understand the purpose for your video is to tie it to a specific stage of the marketing funnel. This clarity helps you tailor every element of your video, from its aspect ratio to its music to the talent casting, to your intended use case.

Decide whether your goal is to drive awareness, move viewers through consideration, or get them to make a decision and convert. Then, refer back to this purpose as you make decisions through the entire production process.

Once you know the purpose for your video, it’s time to [define your audience](https://www.lemonlight.com/blog/how-do-you-find-the-target-audience-for-your-brand-videos/). Your audience may be entirely determined by the video’s purpose itself, or you may have some additional decisions to make about who you plan to target.

For example, if you’re sharing a video on your company’s Instagram page, your audience will largely consist of your existing followers. But if you’re sharing your video as a TV spot or a digital billboard, you’ll want to narrow your target so you know exactly who you’ll be speaking to.

Now that you know your video’s purpose and audience, it’s time to brainstorm! During this stage, it’s important to set expectations that there are no bad ideas. Let everyone involved in the process know that the goal is to get *all* ideas out on the table.

As you brainstorm, make sure your video ideas align with your video’s purpose and target audience. If you work with a video production partner, they’ll be able to guide you through the best practices regarding alignment, but make sure to gut-check every idea by asking if it’s the right approach to speak to your audience and accomplish your intended purpose.

If you get stuck, don’t be afraid to reference other videos you’ve watched and enjoyed recently or explore what else is being created in your industry. Just save this exploration until the end of the process so it doesn’t distract from your original ideas—and make sure to use any reference content as loose inspiration, not an exact roadmap.

Now is the time to determine how much outside support you’ll need—or want—for your video. If you have a robust video production department, an expert videographer, or other video resources internally, you may be able to tackle the entire project in-house. If you need a bit of extra support, you can explore video production freelancers for the parts of the process where you lack expertise.

If you need more comprehensive support or just want an experienced team to guide you through the process, partnering with a [third-party production company](https://www.lemonlight.com/blog/when-do-you-need-a-videographer-vs-a-professional-video-production-company/) is a great idea. They’ll have all the staff and crew members needed to bring your vision to life, and they’ll be able to apply their expertise at every stage of the process to deliver the best results. Additionally, [production companies](https://www.lemonlight.com/blog/video-production-company-or-marketing-agency/) will usually function like project managers for your production, so you can take a bit more of a back seat than you will if you lead the project internally.

![](https://www.lemonlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/LL-CTA-1024x227.png)

If you’re not quite sure which option is best for you, [check out this article](https://www.lemonlight.com/blog/8-unexpected-benefits-of-working-with-a-production-company/) for more information on the benefits of hiring a production company!

At this point, you’re reaching the end of the big-picture planning for your project! Most of the steps that follow are focused on getting set up for production day, so this is one of many milestones to celebrate.

Your budget and timeline are critical benchmarks to keep your production on track. If you skip this step or don’t give it much thought, you may end up with a project that takes much longer (or costs *much* more money) than you expected.

When it comes to the timeline, a general rule of thumb is 8-12 weeks for most projects. If you won’t be filming anything at all (which is typically the case for [stock video projects](https://www.lemonlight.com/blog/what-to-expect-from-your-stock-footage-video-project/) or animation projects), you can likely cut several weeks off that timeline.

How to Schedule Your Next Video Production Timeline

Aug 01, 2024

](https://www.lemonlight.com/blog/how-to-schedule-your-next-video-production-timeline/)

The budget setting process is similar, but the “standard” range varies more widely between projects. The best way to understand the exact [cost of your project](https://www.lemonlight.com/how-much-does-it-cost-to-produce-a-video/) is to talk to your production partner or to start breaking down specific costs if you’ll be managing the production internally.

In general, a basic production that you manage yourself may cost anywhere from $500-$5000, while a complex commercial using a production company can cost $25,000+. If you’re on a tight budget, make sure to set expectations accordingly before you start your project.

If your video will have actor dialogue, [voice-over](https://www.lemonlight.com/blog/voice-overs-what-they-are-and-what-they-do-for-your-videos/) (VO), or on-screen text, having a script to guide these elements is important. If you’ve never worked with a script before, you might be unfamiliar with how it’s broken down. Here’s what we recommend here at Lemonlight:

For each scene, make sure to include a written description of what the set will look like and any other considerations from the environment and the scene’s context. Below that description, you’ll have space for four additional elements: actor dialogue on one line, voice-over on one line, on-screen text on one line, and any visual descriptions, camera or lighting cues, or actor movements on one line.

By structuring the script this way, your crew, talent, and editors can all see exactly how a scene is intended to play out just by looking at the script.

[Writing a great script](https://www.lemonlight.com/blog/great-video-marketing-starts-with-the-script/) is arguably the most important part of your video process. Almost all effective videos start with an engaging hook, then move into some kind of problem/solution format, and end with a CTA.

![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApA01EH-IXM)

For voice-over and dialogue, you’ll also want to keep word count constraints in mind. Your specific constraint may vary a bit depending on how fast you move through the text in the video, but the general rule of thumb is two words per second. By that convention, you’d want to write 60 words or less for a 30-second script, 30 words or less for a 15-second script, and so on.

As you prepare your script, don’t forget to allocate time for revisions and feedback! Depending on how many people are involved and how long they take to share their thoughts, this can add anywhere from a few days to a few weeks to the pre-production process.

For that reason, it’s best to try not to involve *too* many people in the editing process. The more opinions are involved, the more likely you’ll water down the power of your ideas just to appease everyone.

Keep in mind that it’s also common to receive suggestions that don’t take into account the time constraint and word count limit. Set expectations early by explaining those constraints when you send the script for feedback.

If you’re not familiar with a storyboard, you can think of it as a visual-heavy adaptation of your script. Your finished storyboard will look like a panel-by-panel drawing of your entire video, and it helps your set directors, videographers, and other crew members bring your vision to life as accurately as possible on set.

Free Storyboard Template

We designed this template to make the process of assembling and sharing your next professional storyboard much easier.

[View original](https://1697659.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/1697659/Lead%20Magnets/Lemonlight%20-%20Storyboard.pdf)

The storyboard phase is also the time to think through your [camera shots](https://www.lemonlight.com/blog/your-guide-to-the-18-most-important-camera-shots/) and angles. Will one particular scene look best as a close-up? To capture your product effectively, will you need to pan from left to right? Do you want specific b-roll footage incorporated at certain moments in the video?

If you’re new to the video production world, you might not have strong opinions on these elements, so it’s okay to lean on the expertise of your production partner or camera crew and let them guide these elements of the storyboard. But, if you’d like to be involved, try your best to think through each shot of the video and document how you’re picturing it in your head. The more detail and context, the better!

Let’s talk about casting. Casting is one of the stages in the video process that the average person knows the least about. It feels very Hollywood-esque and foreign if you’ve never been involved in a talent search before, but it doesn’t have to be complicated!

There are lots of avenues to look for appropriate talent, but the most popular are online platforms like [Backstage](https://www.backstage.com/) or [Actors Access](https://actorsaccess.com/). On these sites, you’ll share a description of what you’re looking for, and actors will submit themselves for your role, usually by sharing a self-tape (a self-recorded video) of them auditioning for the role.

If this already sounds overwhelming, another alternative is to work with a producer or a casting director with talent experience. And if you hire a production company to help manage your production, they’ll likely handle this step on your behalf.

As you [audition talent](https://www.lemonlight.com/blog/all-about-casting-your-marketing-videos/), it’s easy to get distracted by appearance, charisma, and other factors that may or may not translate to a successful video. Instead, start by considering the audience demographics that you’re targeting in your video, and consider what type of actor would resonate most with your audience.

Then, be wary of actors that are over-acting in their auditions, or of actors who seem not to be able to take direction. If they don’t follow any instructions you provided in the casting call, they’re unlikely to follow directions well on set. Finally, try to be open-minded about exactly who can play the role. You might be surprised by outside perspectives!

If you’re working with an experienced actor, they’ll likely handle all the basic preparation elements independently. They’ll know how to memorize their lines, ask for clarification on any industry- or company-specific language, and adapt their tone to the video’s look and feel.

Just make sure to over-communicate during this phase rather than under-communicate. If there are any specific lines you want emphasized, actions you want the actor to take, or other details that may not be outlined in the script or storyboard, let your talent know as soon as possible so they can prepare accordingly.

We’ve made it to production day! This next section is all about the elements that go into your shoot day itself, including equipment setup, hiring crew members, set design, and the process of shooting itself. Let’s dive in!

High-quality cameras, [lighting](https://www.lemonlight.com/blog/best-video-lighting-tips-for-your-next-production/), and [audio equipment](https://www.lemonlight.com/blog/your-2019-audio-recording-guide-everything-you-need-to-know/) can really make or break your video. If you’re not an expert in this area, we really recommend leaning on your production crew and trusting their recommendations.

When you hire freelance crew members or a third-party production team, they can likely provide their own equipment. This is great because you don’t have to worry about providing input, *and* they’ll already be super familiar with the tools they use on a daily basis.

If you’re taking a DIY approach and filming on a major budget, [this article](https://www.lemonlight.com/blog/filming-on-a-budget-7-cheap-equipment-tips-and-picks-just-for-you/) will help you make decisions accordingly!

Filming on a Budget? 7 Cheap Equipment Tips and Picks Just for You

Feb 14, 2019

](https://www.lemonlight.com/blog/filming-on-a-budget-7-cheap-equipment-tips-and-picks-just-for-you/)

[Hiring crew members](https://www.lemonlight.com/blog/3-tips-for-hiring-a-production-crew/) is similar to hiring talent, but with a few key differences. When you’re [hiring a videographer](https://www.lemonlight.com/blog/when-do-you-need-a-videographer-vs-a-professional-video-production-company/), it’s especially important that you like the look and feel of their past videos. Ask for their demo reel, and if you can see elements of your own vision in their past work, that’s a good sign.

For all other crew members, you’ll want to request their role’s equivalent of a demo reel, portfolio, or personal recommendations from past colleagues. If someone is qualified and capable but a disaster to work with on set, that’s something you’ll want to know before you hire.

Your [shoot location](https://www.lemonlight.com/blog/video-production-101-where-should-i-shoot-my-video/) will depend heavily on what type of video you’re shooting. If you’re shooting a product video, you’ll likely want to film in a production studio. If you’re filming a doc-style video, you may want to film at your business’s own location or office. If you’re filming a lifestyle commercial, the world is your oyster!

If you need an ultra-specific location to match your vision, you may want to work with a location scout to simplify the process. When you find a location that fits the bill, you’ll also want to make sure you have the rights and any necessary permits to film there.

The last phase of video prep will be designing your set. In addition to finding the right location, it’s important to make sure the specific [backdrop for each shot](https://www.lemonlight.com/blog/what-background-should-i-use-for-my-video/) matches your expectations. Consider the lighting, colors, which elements are in focus, and how the backdrop will change from shot to shot.

This is also the time to bring in any [props for your set](https://www.lemonlight.com/blog/how-to-get-props-for-your-production/). Make sure to consult your script and storyboard to see if there are any objects that will need to be used for the video’s main plot, like a cell phone or a cup of water.

![Behind the scenes shot of a filming studio](https://www.lemonlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/AdobeStock_378702004-1-1024x428.jpeg)

Behind the scenes shot of a filming studio

Then, consider what other props need to be brought in to make the set feel natural and complete. If you’re filming in an office setting, for example, you might bring in a lamp, a computer setup, a notepad, and a stapler.

The specifics are up to you, but it’s easy to forget that these small choices make a big difference in your final video!

Your [call sheet](https://www.lemonlight.com/blog/whats-a-call-sheet-and-why-does-your-production-need-one/) is what will guide you, your crew members, and your talent through [production day](https://www.lemonlight.com/blog/what-to-expect-on-your-projects-production-day/). It includes detailed information about which scenes are being shot at what time, who needs to be present for each scene, when there are breaks in the schedule, and when the day is expected to wrap up.

If you’re managing your own production, you’ll want to create your own call sheet to keep you on schedule throughout the day and help everyone understand what their role is at any given time. If you’re working with a production company, they’ll likely create the call sheet on your behalf and send you your copy to reference on set.

When it comes to setting up your equipment, this is another area to lean on the expertise of your crew. If you have a director, videographer, camera operator, grip, gaffer, or other on-set crew members, they’re the only ones who should be managing their equipment. Most pieces of film equipment are expensive and somewhat temperamental, so it’s best to leave the setup to the experts.

For DIY productions, try to take advantage of [natural light](https://www.lemonlight.com/blog/best-video-lighting-tips-for-your-next-production/), frame your subject to the best of your ability, and eliminate ambient noise like air conditioning, street traffic, or talking on set.

It’s okay to treat this part of the process like a bit of a trial and error situation—that’s how the pros do it, too! Just make sure to take a few test shots when you think you have everything the way you want it, and make sure the output is what you expected. If it’s not, make the necessary tweaks and repeat!

As you capture footage, one important best practice is to make a note of any shots that differ from the call sheet. Whether you’re swapping out props, changing lighting, altering the dialogue from the script, or making any other little tweaks, write down the timestamp of the shot and what changed from the original intention.

When capturing footage, make sure to get b-roll, too! If you’ve prepared correctly, your b-roll shots will be documented on your call sheet along with the rest of the scenes, but make sure to capture those shots if you might need them in your final video.

We’ve made it to [post-production](https://www.lemonlight.com/7-things-you-need-to-know-about-video-post-production/)! This is the phase of the process when your final video really comes together. Your editors will work their magic, stringing together the narrative, possibly adding graphics, and generally making your content look as polished and professional as possible. Learn the specifics below!

The first step in the post-production process is assembling and organizing the footage from your shoot day. If there were multiple cameras on set, each camera will have its own files, and your editors will spend some time separating the footage and getting their bearings for the general narrative.

This is also where they’ll reference any notes you took on shoot day, like shots that changed from the storyboard reference info or clips that were ruined by bad audio or other disruptions. Once they have the best clips selected, they’ll string them together according to your storyboard and the final video will begin to take shape.

What Are the Best Video Editing Apps in 2025?

Jul 03, 2025

](https://www.lemonlight.com/blog/what-are-the-best-video-editing-apps/)

The outcome of this step is called the “rough cut,” and it’s often when your editors will share the content with you for review. If you approve the sequence of clips and the general flow of the video, it’ll move on to the next steps in the editing process.

If your video requires any specific effects or transitions, your editors will add them in now. These visual effects should have also been outlined in your storyboard, so there likely won’t be any surprises at this point in the process.

You may be given the chance to review the video again (or possibly for the first time) after this part of the process, or you may wait for your next review until after the sound mix and color correction have taken place.

Next, your editors will add the audio elements of your video. This step is important because it incorporates basic audio elements like dialogue and voice-over with other elements like music and sound effects.

It’s also when your editors will eliminate any ambient noise from the background and balance out the different audio sources so their relative volumes are logical and appropriate.

Sound editing and sound mixing are so important that they both have their own categories for the Academy Awards!

As you select music, remember that choosing the right track can completely change the tone and feel of your video. The ideal music will emphasize the most important shots in the video, set the mood for how viewers should be interpreting the content, and add to the viewing experience without being distracting.

It can sometimes take a few tries to get the music to feel right for the final video, so don’t be afraid to hear different options before you commit.

Whether you’re the one choosing the music or you’re just approving the editor’s selection, make sure to also confirm that you have the [rights to use the music](https://www.lemonlight.com/blog/how-to-use-music-legally-in-your-marketing-videos/) in your video! The last thing you want is a copyright infringement issue when you’re ready to distribute your content.

[Color grading](https://www.lemonlight.com/blog/video-colors-and-filters-to-know-to-create-videos-like-the-pros/) is the step of the post-production process that makes your video clips look like they do in real life. Before any color correction has taken place, your editors will be working with [raw footage](https://www.lemonlight.com/blog/raw-footage-what-it-is-and-why-its-useful/), which looks deliberately flat as a clean slate for the editors to work with.

To optimize the visuals in your video, editors will use brightness, white balance, color match tools, contrast, and other tools and tweaks to bring life back into your footage and balance colors effectively.

When you’re ready to export the final video, you’re in the home stretch of your production! At this point, you’ll want to consider what you’re exporting the video for. If you’re trying to get a quick version of the video file to send someone else for review, a lower-resolution export will be fine. If you’re exporting the final video to post on [YouTube](https://www.lemonlight.com/blog/5-ways-to-promote-your-youtube-videos-using-other-marketing-channels/), you’ll want to select a higher resolution from the export settings menu.

For the most efficient process, you’ll also want to close any unnecessary apps and tabs before you start exporting. The export process can be time-consuming, and the more programs you have open competing for processing speed, the longer your export will take.

Next, you’ll need to decide where to host your video. The three most common options are YouTube, Vimeo, and self-hosting on your own server. There are a few differences that are important to consider.

The biggest [difference between YouTube and Vimeo](https://www.lemonlight.com/blog/youtube-vs-vimeo-the-key-differences-in-2023/) is that YouTube videos are searchable by the general public, while Vimeo videos are not. This makes a difference if you’re trying to capture organic traffic from your video, but it may not matter if all your viewers will come from a direct link.

Compared to self-hosting, the main difference is server storage costs. If you already have a dedicated server that can host your video, this option may work fine. If not, you may introduce hefty storage fees that you won’t experience on YouTube or Vimeo.

By the time you’re ready to distribute your video, you should already have an idea of where you’re planning to share it. Ideally, these [distribution platforms](https://www.lemonlight.com/blog/rethink-your-video-strategy-why-platform-specific-creative-is-the-key-to-success/) would have informed your video strategy from the very beginning, as we highlighted above.

When you’re ready to post your video, make sure that the aspect ratio aligns with the specs for your platform(s) of choice so you get the highest-quality output. If you share on a channel that has additional fields to complete, like titles, thumbnails, and video descriptions, make sure to fill out that information, too. Those extra steps can be the difference between a video that goes viral and a video that barely gets any traction.

Chances are, you’re already familiar with all the most [common distribution channels](https://www.lemonlight.com/blog/20-places-to-post-your-video-now-that-its-done-1/), which include YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, [LinkedIn](https://www.lemonlight.com/blog/linkedin-sponsored-message-ads-how-video-can-boost-your-strategy/), your website, your [email marketing channels](https://www.lemonlight.com/blog/best-practices-when-using-video-for-email-marketing/), and more.

When choosing a video production company, it’s important to have a basic understanding of the different types of marketing videos available, even if you’re unsure which style is best suited for your brand. Understanding the different types of videos and how they perform at [each stage of the marketing funnel](https://www.lemonlight.com/blog/the-right-video-content-for-your-marketing-funnel/) can help you put your marketing dollars to the best use.

By knowing which types of videos work best for your target audience, you can create videos that are more effective at generating leads and driving conversions. Additionally, having a basic understanding of the different types of videos can help prevent production companies from charging you for services you don’t need.

Here are the five main types of marketing videos you should consider for your brand:

A brand video, also called an “About Us” video, is a type of marketing video that focuses on telling the story of a brand, rather than promoting a specific product or service. Brand videos can be used to create an emotional connection with potential customers and build brand awareness. They are effective at showcasing the brand’s values, mission, and personality, and can help establish a unique brand identity.

To create a successful brand video, it’s important to focus on storytelling and emotion, rather than creating a sales pitch. The video should have a clear narrative that connects with the viewer and communicates exactly what the brand is about.

A [product video](https://www.lemonlight.com/blog/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-product-video-ads/) is a type of marketing video that showcases a product or service in action, highlighting its features and benefits. Product videos can be used to introduce a new product or service, educate potential customers on how to use it, or persuade them to make a purchase. They are effective at capturing the viewer’s attention and providing a visual demonstration of the product or service.

To create a successful product video, it’s important to focus on the product’s unique selling points and highlight how it solves a problem or addresses a need. The video should also be visually engaging, using high-quality footage and creative storytelling to keep the viewer locked in. Incorporating customer testimonials or endorsements can also help build credibility and trust with potential customers. Additionally, it is important to keep the video concise and to the point, conveying the key benefits of the product in a short amount of time.

[Testimonial videos](https://www.lemonlight.com/blog/10-powerful-customer-testimonial-videos-done-right/) feature real customers sharing their experiences and opinions about a product or service. Testimonial videos can be highly effective at building trust and credibility with potential customers, as they provide authentic perspectives on the brand’s offerings. They are often used as a form of social proof, helping to demonstrate the value of a product or service through the words of satisfied customers.

To create a successful testimonial video, it’s important to identify the right customers to feature, as well as to ask the right questions to elicit meaningful responses. The video should focus on telling a story through the customer’s experience, highlighting the specific benefits and outcomes that they have achieved as a result of using the product or service. Testimonials are a great way not only to increase sales, but also create brand advocates who will share their love of your brand across their networks.

An [explainer video](https://www.lemonlight.com/blog/what-is-an-explainer-video/) is designed to explain a product, service, or idea in a clear and engaging way. They are often animated and use a combination of visuals, voiceover, and text to convey complex information in a simple and easy-to-understand format. Explainer videos are best used for introducing a new product or service, or for providing a deeper understanding of how an existing product or service works. Highly technical industries such as software companies typically find the most success with these types of marketing videos.

Explainer videos should be structured in a way that guides the viewer through the information in a logical and intuitive way, helping them to fully understand the product or service being explained. Furthermore, they can be a valuable tool for building brand awareness and establishing thought leadership, as explainer videos can help to position a brand as an expert in their field and showcase their unique value proposition.

Team videos highlight the members of a company’s team, showcasing their skills, expertise, and personality. These videos are best used for [recruitment](https://www.lemonlight.com/blog/how-video-content-can-transform-your-recruiting-efforts/) and building brand awareness. By showing potential recruits and customers the people behind the company, team videos create a personal connection and can help to build trust and credibility. Team videos can also be used internally to boost morale and create a sense of community among team members.

To be successful, team videos should focus on the people behind the company and their unique qualities, rather than simply promoting the company itself. Authenticity is key, and it’s important to let team members speak in their own words and showcase their individual personalities. High-quality production techniques such as professional lighting and sound, well-composed shots, and well-crafted scripts can elevate the video and create a polished finished product. However, it’s also important to balance the desire for a polished video with the need for authenticity and genuine human connection.

Crowdfunding videos aim to raise funds for a project or business through online crowdfunding platforms. These videos are best used for new or innovative projects that may not have traditional funding sources, such as new product development or artistic endeavors. By showcasing the vision, passion, and potential impact of the project, crowdfunding videos can inspire backers to invest in the idea and help make it a reality.

To be successful, crowdfunding videos should be visually striking and emotionally compelling. They should tell a story that connects with the viewer and communicates the value and impact of the project. Additionally, it’s important to clearly communicate the funding goals and deadlines, to encourage viewers to take action and contribute.

Picking a video production partner to produce marketing videos can be a challenging task for companies. The main reason for this difficulty is the sheer number of options available in the market. [With the rise of video marketing](https://www.lemonlight.com/blog/video-production-company-or-marketing-agency/), many video production companies have entered the market, many of which offering the same services and promising the same results.

Additionally, companies may not have a clear understanding of what type of video they need for their marketing strategy. They may know that they need a video, but they may not know if they need an explainer video, a brand video, a product video, etc.

This lack of clarity can make it challenging to find a production partner that understands their needs and can deliver a high-quality video that aligns with their marketing goals. As a result, companies need to do their due diligence, research the options available, and find a production partner that has a proven track record and can help them define their [video marketing](https://www.lemonlight.com/video-marketing-strategy-the-ultimate-guide/) needs.

Here are a few best practices to guide your search:

The first step in choosing a video production company is to research their portfolio. Look for videos they’ve created in the past and assess their quality. The company’s portfolio should showcase their expertise—and while a range of styles is nice to see, watch out for production companies that prioritize casting a wide net instead of perfecting a certain style.

With that said, check if they have experience creating videos in your industry or for your target audience. You can also read reviews or testimonials from their previous clients to get a better understanding of their capabilities.

The production process is another important factor to consider when choosing a video production company. You want to ensure that the company has a well-defined process that aligns with your goals and expectations. This includes their approach to concept development, scripting, storyboarding, filming, editing, and post-production. Additionally, the company should be transparent about their timelines and deliverables, so you know what to expect at each stage of the project.

The quality of your video will largely depend on the equipment and resources used by the production company. Ensure that they have access to the latest video production equipment, including cameras, lighting, sound equipment, and editing software. Check if they have in-house team or resources to secure the necessary writers, animators, and designers, to create engaging content that aligns with your brand messaging.

Communication is a crucial aspect of any successful project. The video production company should have clear and prompt communication channels in place, preferably ones that allow you visual updates on where you video is in the process, such video conferencing. Many professional companies will also have their own [proprietary intelligence platforms](https://www.lemonlight.com/how-it-works/) that streamline the video production process, making communication and management of your project much easier.

Your production company should also be responsive to your queries and concerns throughout the production process. A reliable company will assign you a dedicated project manager who can answer any questions or concerns you have about the project.

Every company has different video production needs, and a one-size-fits-all approach may not work. The video production company you choose should be flexible and offer customizable packages that can cater to your unique needs. This includes options such as video length, filming locations, and post-production services. A company that can adapt to your needs will be more likely to deliver a video that meets your expectations.

Pricing is an important factor to consider when choosing a video production company. While you want to get the best value for your money, it’s essential to avoid choosing a company solely based on their pricing. A company that offers rock-bottom prices may not be able to deliver the quality you’re looking for. Instead, focus on finding a company that offers competitive pricing that aligns with your budget and project goals.

<iframe title="Thought Leadership, Josh Kaufman - The Benefits of Having a Long-Term Video Production Parnter" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/834511168?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963" width="1200" height="675" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media"></iframe>

Once a brand has found a video production partner that aligns with their goals and objectives, they can work together to create a consistent brand image across all their video content. Establishing a long-term relationship comes with many benefits, including:

By choosing a long-term video production partner, brands can save money in the long run. A production partner who understands the brand’s messaging and has worked with them before can produce videos more efficiently, leading to cost-savings. Additionally, it allows brands to negotiate better rates given the consistent workload, prompting the production company to offer more cost-savings over time.

Working with a video production partner over an extended period allows them to develop a deeper understanding of the brand’s messaging, tone, and style. This understanding can translate into consistent video quality and better alignment with the brand’s goals and objectives. A long-term partner can also make suggestions for new video ideas that align with the brand’s messaging and target audience.

Hiring a professional video production company may not be the cheapest option, but the level of expertise and efficiency they offer can make it worth the investment in the long run. Working with freelancers or going the DIY route and producing videos in-house can certainly be more cost-effective, but both options come with drawbacks that could end up creating more expenses and headaches down the line.

While working with freelancers can be cost-effective, they may not have access to the best video production equipment, resulting in a lower quality video. Additionally, freelancers may not have the bandwidth to work on large-scale projects or may not have the experience to handle complex video production projects. Brands may also have to spend more time finding and managing multiple freelancers, leading to additional costs and time investments.

Learning the necessary techniques and keeping production in-house is a way to save a buck or two, but it can quickly become expensive if the brand needs to purchase video production equipment or hire talent. Additionally, the quality of the video may not be up to par given novice understanding, leading to a negative impact on the brand’s image. DIY video production can be time-consuming as you’re still learning while also trying to execute, taking away resources from other important marketing activities.
