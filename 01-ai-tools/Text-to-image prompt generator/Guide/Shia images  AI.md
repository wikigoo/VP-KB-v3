## 7. Practical examples and patterns

### 7.1 Scenes of Ashura

#### The Return of Dhul-Jinnah

"The Evening of Ashura: Imam Hussein's white horse Zuljanah  
returns riderless to the burning tents of Karbala. The noble  
Arabian stallion, with bloodstained saddle and flowing mane  
caught by desert wind, carries the empty sword sheath and  
green cloak of his martyred master. Grieving women and  
children in black gather around the magnificent horse under  
a dramatic orange-red sunset sky filled with smoke and dust.  
The composition captures profound sorrow and divine tragedy  
through the horse's expressive eyes and noble bearing.  
Painted in Persian classical art style with cinematic  
lighting, featuring deep crimson and amber tones,  
ultra-detailed emotional realism, 16:9 cinematic format."

  

Negative: "low quality, cartoonish, inappropriate content,  
western style, modern elements"

  

#### Hazrat Abbas beside the Euphrates

"Sacred portrayal of Hazrat Abbas beside the Euphrates River:  
The brave standard-bearer stands in gleaming silver armor  
holding the ceremonial Alam with five-fingered hand emblem.  
His noble silhouette is shown against the flowing river  
at harsh midday sun, with date palms lining the banks.  
An empty water skin lies at his feet, symbolizing his  
ultimate sacrifice for the thirsty children of Karbala.  
Dust particles dance in golden sunlight while the river  
sparkles with divine luminescence. The scene emphasizes  
the contrast between abundant water and imposed thirst.  
Rendered in heroic Persian realism with warm golden and  
blue tones, dramatic side lighting, vertical 3:4 format,  
embodying the courage of Qamar Bani Hashim."

  

Negative: "facial features, inappropriate imagery, low detail"

  

### 7.2 Contemporary Ceremonies

#### Arbaeen Walk

"Epic panorama of the Arbaeen pilgrimage: Millions of  
black-clad devotees walk the sacred path from Najaf to  
Karbala at golden dawn. The endless procession carries  
colorful flags with 'Ya Hussein' calligraphy and green  
banners from different nations. The journey stretches  
to the horizon where twin golden domes gleam in distance.  
Pilgrims of all ages move with purpose - elderly supported  
by youth, mothers carrying children, all united in devotion.  
Roadside Mawakib offer free services, their vibrant tents  
dotting the landscape. The composition captures the largest  
peaceful gathering on Earth, showing enduring love and  
remembrance. Documentary realism with Persian artistic  
influences, warm earth tones with flag colors,  
ultra-wide 21:9 panoramic format."

  

#### Breastfeeding at night

"Night procession of Ashura: Large group of men in black  
performing Sineh-zani (chest beating) in perfect unison  
under streetlights. Their faces show intense devotion  
and sorrow as they move through city streets. A leader  
with microphone recites elegies while the crowd responds  
rhythmically. Tall Alams with silver emblems and flowing  
banners tower above the procession. The scene captures  
passionate grief and collective remembrance in urban  
setting. Photojournalistic style with dramatic night  
lighting, authentic emotions, documentary quality,  
16:9 format for news coverage."

  

### 7.3 Spiritual show

#### Strangers' Dinner

"The Night of Sham-e Ghariban: Orphaned children and women  
of the Holy Family gather in Karbala desert darkness,  
illuminated only by flickering candles in their hands.  
Each small flame creates warm circles of light on  
grief-stricken faces while casting long shadows into  
vast darkness. Burnt tent remnants scatter across  
moonlit sand, with date palm silhouettes against  
star-filled sky. The crescent moon provides gentle  
illumination from above. Classical Persian miniature  
style with emotional depth, predominantly dark blues  
and blacks punctuated by golden candlelight,  
4:5 portrait format, deeply contemplative mood."
