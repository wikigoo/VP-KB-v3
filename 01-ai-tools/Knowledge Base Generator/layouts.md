This manual is a quick reference of editorial rules, SEO constraints, structure guidelines, and QA checks to be used as context for a Blog Post Writer assistant.

## Core Editorial Rules
- Audience must be named in the first 100 words.
- One main idea per paragraph; paragraphs should be 2–3 sentences.
- Use H2 for main sections, H3 for subsections only.
- Always include at least one concrete example or statistic per main section when available.

## SEO and Metadata Rules
- Meta title: 50–60 characters, include primary keyword near start.
- Meta description: 140–160 characters, compelling and value-driven.
- Primary keyword usage: in title, H1, and within first 100 words.
- Keyword density: aim for 1–2% for primary keyword; natural usage for secondary keywords.
- Provide 1–3 internal link suggestions when INTERNAL_LINKS are provided.

## Structure Template (recommended)

- If user requests information outside scope: "This request is outside the scope of the current assistant; please provide additional domain references."

## Short SOP for fact checks
- Prefer primary sources.
- If external sources list provided, cite them at the end under "Sources".

# 5 Beginner Steps to Better Landscape Photos

**Deck:** Practical, weekend-ready steps to improve landscape photography.

## Outline
- H2: Choose the right time of day
- H2: Master basic composition
- H2: Use appropriate camera settings
- H2: Simple editing tips
- H2: Conclusion with action items

## Article
### Choose the right time of day
Golden hour (shortly after sunrise or before sunset) provides warm, directional light that enhances texture and depth. Scout a location the day before to identify the best vantage point.

### Master basic composition
Use the rule of thirds and look for strong foreground interest to lead the viewer's eye. Try different vantage points: kneel, climb, or move laterally.

### Use appropriate camera settings
For wide landscapes, start with ISO 100, aperture f/8–f/16, and shutter speed as needed for exposure. Use a tripod for exposures longer than 1/60s.

### Simple editing tips
Crop for better balance; adjust exposure and contrast; apply subtle vibrance changes rather than heavy saturation.

### Conclusion
Practice one technique per shoot: choose time of day this weekend, practice composition, and shoot RAW to enable better editing.
- Action item 1: Scout one location in your neighborhood.
- Action item 2: Bring a tripod and set aperture to f/11.
- Action item 3: Export three raw edits and compare.

# Nature Photography Consultant — Consultant Manual

Practical heuristics and checklists for common nature photography scenarios.

## Camera Settings Heuristics

- 100–400mm: distant wildlife

## Composition Rules
- Use leading lines and foreground interest to add depth.
- Keep horizons level unless intentionally breaking the rule.
- Isolate subjects with selective depth of field for wildlife portraits.

## Fieldcraft & Ethics
- Do not bait wildlife.
- Keep respectful distance; use telephoto lenses.
- Leave-no-trace: pack out what you bring.

## Field Checklist (example)
- Batteries ×2 charged
- Memory cards formatted
- Lens cloth and blower
- Tripod/monopod
- Weatherproof bag
- Headlamp
- Map/tide times (if applicable)
